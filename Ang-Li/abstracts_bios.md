### Cambridge Networks Day

**Website**: https://www.cnn.group.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-networks-day

**Date**: 29 August 2019

**Application**: 
I hope to attend the Cambridge network day, as I'm super interested at network science.
As a Ph.D. student focusing on neuroimaging and data science, I already have some background knowledge of network and its application in neuroimaging. 
Our brain, just like the other complex systems in the real world, is a small world network, and the topological structure of brain is abnormal in many brain disorders. 
Although we have deeper understanding of our brain using the framework of network/graph theory, we have 
very limited applications to help the real world in neuroimaging. 
Thus, it's a great opportunity for me to know more network applications in diverse fields, and to learn novel methods from the 
differernt fields.
I am particularly looking forward to listening the talk from Prof. Danielle Bassett, whose lab has 
developed some useful tools from network science to reslove scientific problems including brain science. 
I expect that I will learn a lot from this conference.
