### Date: 3rd November 2018

#### Who did you help this week?

* I had two meetings w folks who were struggling in various ways in academia.
  I'm not super sure how much I helped but maybe it's sometimes just nice to be heard.
* I facilitated the first session that I went to at MozFest because the designated folks
  didn't turn up!

#### Who helped you this week?

* GK & EdP w OHBM SIG stuff
* EdP for all the amazing conversations about governance in a bunch of projects
* All the MozFellows for being so wonderful :heart_eyes:

#### What did you achieve?

* Proud of the governance documentation and the roadmap for `tedana`:tada:
  * Currently open for comments: https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana/pull/151
* Got things moving for the Turing Way project - email, github repo & call :sparkles:
  * Got a lovely email from FP that made me smile :smiley_cat:
* Had a good time at MozFest - enjoyed seeing all my friends, but generally
felt pretty overwhelmed by all the problems :sob:
  * I was particularly proud of MK's session and I really enjoyed meeting a
  bunch of different people for coffee and a chat
* Got the OHBM Open Science SIG request for annual funding sent off :raised_hands:
* Had a useful *Automating The Crowd* event planning meeting
* Was quoted in MZ's piece on open source in Cambodia
  * https://thediplomat.com/2018/10/cambodias-coming-ai-revolution
* Had a great call w GA planning new project

#### What did you struggle with?

* I generally felt pretty useless this week - partly just the same feeling of being
  behind on everything all the time, and partly just really overwhelmed by the fact
  that there are no easy solutions to make the world a better place.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I'm at SFN this week and I'd like to use the time to refind some joy and balance!
  I'm looking forward to seeing a bunch of friends and hopefully getting some work done
  with no meetings!! :grimacing:
* In particular I need to push on NSPN data management tasks and get sorted out with emails
* If I can get the EAG and OSSIG emails under control I think that would be a big weight
  off my shoulders. 🤞

#### Where do you need help?

* I'd really love to have some more content on the lab website, I think if I can
  get some of my projects wrangled then I might be in a good position to ask
  people to write me some updates.
* I'd also really love to have help in drawing out some schematic diagrams for
  papers. If anyone knows folks who can do that (happy to pay) that would be
  really cool :sparkles:

#### Any other topics

I know these updates have been sounding super morose for a while now, but it does
really help to do them, even if they make me feel rather overwhelmed!

### Date: 26th October 2018

This was written at Craft London outside Ravensbourne where MozFest is just getting started.
I have super mega FOMO for the amazing facilitator training that's happening right now.
It's really strange not wrangling again this year!

I do need to protect time for writing and strategy though. I've blocked off some time next week. Fingers crossed that works.

### Date: 21st August 2018

#### Who did you help this week?

### Date: 13th August 2018

#### Who did you help this *last three months* 🙀?

Ok, so I'm not **really** going to note all the things I've done in the last few months.
Let's instead go for a few bullet points from [Neurohackademy](http://neurohackademy.org):

* I taught a bunch of people a git & github workflow which lead to [Dan submitting a PR to Nilearn](https://twitter.com/DanJGale/status/1027357249553879041) that same day!! :sparkling_heart::heart_eyes::raised_hands:
* I gave a [talk on collaborative working](http://bit.ly/NH18-OpenForAll-Slides) and thinking about how science should be open to all which quite a few people said was interesting. Here's the etherpad notes: bit.ly/NH18-OpenForAll-Pad.

#### Who helped you this week?

* All the participants during the hacking part of Neurohackademy were CRAZY inspirational - I really felt like they were picking up what I was putting down :sparkles:
* RM taught me a bunch of cool stuff - particularly wrt `setup.py` and how it relates to `pip install`
* CG helped with brainstorming some ways forwards for BEP001
* IS made killer progress on Brain Networks in Python
* PP did amazing work on the BIDS Starter Kit (got shouted out in Russ Poldrack's talk at INCF!)
* Really really appreciated AR's mentorship over coffee in Seattle
* Fernando Perez gave me a hug and listened to me while I cried and I think that's going to be a huge moment for assessing what's important in my life. Such an inspiration.

#### What did you achieve?

* Talk at Neurohackademy: bit.ly/NH18-OpenForAll-Slides
* Collaborative working at Neurohackademy - lots of great issues & pull requests happening within the groups which was *exactly why I went*!
* Got AK to apply to Moz Open Leaders (she's going to change the world)
* Gave some feedback to CGvP's grant application
* Got a bunch of other parcellations run on NSPN longitudinal data
* Edits to PP's [final report for GSoC](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS-Starter-Kit/blob/cded291fd8c4a108e02ca76e023f1b47b06b675f/reports/Google-2018-report.md)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Oooph, I am behind on so many things. I'm finding it hard to move forwards and not get kinda overwhelmed by the to do list 😭

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I really want to get to a point where I feel like my to do list is at least documented (I don't think it will ever be undercontrol!) I have no idea how achievable that is...but I do know that my phone is not the place to coordinate everything.
* NSPN longitudinal day on Tuesday
* DSG reports Wednesday
* STEM Gamechangers reviews on Wednesday

#### Where do you need help?

* I want to try to be more strategic about what I say yes to....which is NOT easy for me. I think trying to actively seek help is a good idea. I'm not sure how but maybe I can try to open those conversations a little more.
* BEP001
* NSPN FP
* DSG reports
* DS4S event website

(these will all take longer than I have in 3 days this week....but lets see where i get to! :grimacing:)

#### Any other topics

Ariel made a great point that writing is useful **to me**. To help collect thoughts together and to keep them organised. I'm going to try to remember that as I try to put off writing blog posts or updating this form. It may feel slower but it's actually faster in the long run, especially if it helps me get out of this constant fire extinguisher phase!! 🔥🚒😫

### Date: 26th June 2018

#### Who did you help this month?

* My amazing donors [raised $10,000](http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/kirstie) for the SF AIDS Foundation and the LA LGBT Center!
* Helped to organise a really spectacular BrainHack & TrainTrack🚂 in Singapore (https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2018)


#### Who helped you this week?

I'm really enjoying monitoring my time, I think it really helps me to think carefully about what I'm focusing on.

I'd like to work harder at keeping my project board up to date, including with PRs/issues from various other repos. Not sure how best to do that, but probably just setting aside time and searching through notifications/ones assigned to me?
