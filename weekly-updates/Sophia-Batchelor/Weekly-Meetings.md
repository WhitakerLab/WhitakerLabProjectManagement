*Sophia & Kirstie meet every 2 weeks on Tuesdays*


## Date: 26 October 2021
#### Who did you help this week?
* MIT Reality Hack ran this weekend and it involved a lot of world building (in VR) and I was roped in to help run the event
* Lots of things going on at home :house:
* Jumped on with some of the Hacktober github threads (not as much as I would have liked)
* Picked friends up from the airport for a conference
* Am supporting a VR research team back in NZ with some work
* Had a design work session for AutSPACEs 🎨
* LC with jumping in to chair lab 

#### Who helped you this week?
* Synced with some VR folk and am pulling together the visa application. Am incredibly grateful to everyone for their support.
* Had an informal "let's circle back after this conference" job talk which gave me a lot of hope 
* KW chat over job prospects

#### What did you achieve?
* Had 2 job interviews

* Finished chapter of a "read for fun" book
* Connected with a professor at westminster in comp bio 
* Applied for November's Data Study Group 📊 💻

#### What did you struggle with?
* The workload for the MIT project was a lot more than it was advertised to be. I would have preffered to be brought in earlier and helped lay strong foundations instead of being used as a firefighter but either way the event was super cool (just exhausting).
* Feeling spread super thin trying to search for "all and any jobs I qualify for" and am sinking a lot of time on the resume.
* Feeling really "imposter-y" as I don't feel connected to my skills or "achievements" that I've done before. 
* Am very overwhelmed about resumes.
* Still no feedback from Leeds.

#### What would you like to work on in the next two weeks?
* AutSPACEs design brief 
* AutSPACEs design template 
* Turing Way (There's an issue about the design and usability and I would love to dive in and help lend some UX/design thinking)

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?


#### Anything else?
* Review of meetings (since not going to do supervision, would it help to bump these off the calendar?)
* Trying to not step on toes while I'm in a "low battery" state 🔋

* 📬 Got back into the Slack so am feeling more in touch with the going-ons! (two accounts though, don't entirely understand why)
* ✍️ Worked on the citizen science paper with GA

#### What did you struggle with?
* Feeling overwhelmed and tired. It took most of last week to recharge after the work push as emotional batteries kept getting drained each day. 
* Generally pretty homesick at the moment, the trip to Kew Gardens helped. 

#### What would you like to work on in the next week?
* Registered Report: turning the pieces of the transfer report and the excess material into an RR submission
  * GOAL: have each section of the "what you need to include" addressed in draft form 
* ❗Fellowship Application❗

  * I trimmed it down massively to stay under word count and feedback on 1) legibility, and 2) correctness would be appreciated.    
  * KW: Interesting exploration! Make up some data into a csv file and use it to demonstrate the findings.
    * I think you're looking at a 2 way repeated measures ANOVA, but I'm not clear on how the covariates come in so that might need some exploration. Same with the Bayes for equivalence.

  * although I had already done up a snazzy resume so that's now there and has been updated for 2021 
* Research themes with descriptions
  * Have created doc for those and iterated on them so they're snazzy! (ie. v1 had the two themes - remote research and transfer of learning. v2 has 'everything is about learning' which creates a smoother narrative. what was written for remote research and citizen science can be used for grant apps and other work)   
* Current research description

  * next step is to add it to the doc
