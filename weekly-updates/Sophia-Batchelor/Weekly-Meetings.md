# Sophia Bi-Weekly Updates

*Sophia & Kirstie meet every 2 weeks on Tuesdays*


### Date: 22 June 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

There is a workshop on The Turing Way happening in July that I'm helping run with MS, SG, and VP who is new.
A team member was on the struggle :bus: with similar issues to mine regarding research and being stuck so we had a long chat.


#### Who helped you this week?

SG is helping me get unstuck with the ssh/git account issues
KW with a few check-ins and lovely phone call
LK had a fantastic chat about ethics and tech research on thursday
MS did a wonderful organization with getting the call set up for the workshop call
SU/MB was amazing with helping get admin sorted
PM & MB had a great chat

#### What did you achieve?

* Got a draft of lit review section done
* I started outlining a theory/model that the literature suggests and I can directly investigate
* Conquered fear and roller skated
* Set up a supportive routine

#### What did you struggle with?

* Time and mental energy - I run out of steam so quickly during the day
* Working on task backlogs and finding joy
* Just hitting a wall with two immoveable objects - had a proud moment of progress on Monday

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* The meet up landing page (aka. moving off Notion and to a webpage)
* sort out the git/ssh so that BrainOnSilicon is the "core" account

#### What bought you joy this week?

* reading and finding some cool "puzzle pieces" in the literature
* after a few false starts, I got up on roller skates for a bit :rainbow:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* This week I will generate a landing page for the meetup - when that is done I would like a review in order to maintain alignment.
* a brainstorm for how to respond to an email from RR

#### Any other topics

AgendaBot in meetings - are they helpful and should they come back this week?
Have been advised to take 4 weeks leave, do not feel it's possible to do so at this point but may take the remaining 2 weeks after the 30th.
