#### What did you achieve?

##### Based off last meeting's goals 
* I was more mindful about the ways in which I can help support people (in all ways) 
* Website (it's a few hours away from getting finished - with no automation yet), and then I'll update git
  * ‚ùó hampered by computer breaking down (the issue hadn't been fixed) so I couldn't progress   
* Resume
  * As per our chelmsford chats, I went all in on the phd and withdrew resources from window shopping jobs 
  * although I had already done up a snazzy resume so that's now there and has been updated for 2021 
* Research themes with descriptions
  * Have created doc for those and iterated on them so they're snazzy! (ie. v1 had the two themes - remote research and transfer of learning. v2 has 'everything is about learning' which creates a smoother narrative. what was written for remote research and citizen science can be used for grant apps and other work)   
* Current research description
  * This is in a MVP/bullet point state where there's an outline but it's not fleshed out  
* ~~The~~ Some key papers pulled out and in a slide deck
  * not in a slide deck, but in a doc! 


##### General achievements 

* üë©‚Äçüéì Transfer Report 
  * Made epic level progress!! 
  * Have reached word count! (yay!) so am less worried about that and now get to fill in the blanks and choose the best way to express things 
  * (also am still worried about it but the chance of failure is now so much lower) 
  * this week will be filling in the gaps (writing) and then the efforts will be about improvements as opposed to fixing leaks. 
* üñ•Ô∏è Built a PC!! It's my first PC build!! AND I HAVE A WORKING COMPUTER AGAIN!! 
* Done draft of bio for the whitaker website 
  * next step is to add it to the doc 
* Made it back to a morning coffee
* Have been going on awesome walks more recently and finding the groove 
* Am generally just reaping the rewards of the work put in to find the routine/balance and that's pretty cool 


#### What did you struggle with?

* Anything and everything computer related 
* Had a very disheartening and unhelpful monday meeting about the project which I just struggled with in general as it made me loose steam
* energy drain from life immoveables stunted progress 
* Getting the courage to email PM about the TR 
  * I completed an interim step as a consolidation prize and emailed the head of PGR studies to 1) ask advice on emailing PM, 2) outline the worries, 3) ask advice on the worries. 
    * I haven't heard back yet. 

#### What would you like to work on in the next week?

* Packing up apt in Leeds (scheduled for tomorrow and thursday)
* Transfer Report (14 days to hand in)  

#### What brought you joy this week?

* Advice on what to cut out/down for the Transfer Report 
* 10-15 mins brainstorm time on maze vs. sandbox 


#### Any other topics
