#### Any other topics

* AgendaBot in meetings - are they helpful and should they come back this week?
  * KW: Check w LC, I don't think we need AgendaBot per se, but finding ways for you to participate with ease / sustainably is a high priority.
    If that's AgendaBot then that's fine with me ü§ñ
* Have been advised to take 4 weeks leave, do not feel it's possible to do so at this point but may take the remaining 2 weeks after the 30th.
