# Sophia Bi-Weekly Updates

*Sophia & Kirstie meet every 2 weeks on Tuesdays*

### Date: 22 June 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* There is a workshop on The Turing Way happening in July that I'm helping run with MS, SG, and VP who is new.
  * KW: So fun! Thank you!
* A team member was on the struggle :bus: with similar issues to mine regarding research and being stuck so we had a long chat.
  * KW: 😭😭 I'm really glad you are able to look out for each other 

#### Who helped you this week?

* SG is helping me get unstuck with the ssh/git account issues
* KW with a few check-ins and lovely phone call
* LK had a fantastic chat about ethics and tech research on thursday
* MS did a wonderful organization with getting the call set up for the workshop call
* SU/MB was amazing with helping get admin sorted
* PM & MB had a great chat

KW: SO LOVELY to have such great community around you - I'm really glad ✨

#### What did you achieve?

* Got a draft of lit review section done
* I started outlining a theory/model that the literature suggests and I can directly investigate
* Conquered fear and roller skated
  * KW: Roller skate emoji doesn't work yet! But here's a rainbow 🌈
* Set up a supportive routine
  * KW: Love this 🌺

#### What did you struggle with?

* Time and mental energy - I run out of steam so quickly during the day
* Working on task backlogs and finding joy
* Just hitting a wall with two immoveable objects - had a proud moment of progress on Monday

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* The meet up landing page (aka. moving off Notion and to a webpage)
* sort out the git/ssh so that BrainOnSilicon is the "core" account
  * KW: DELETE EVERYTHING AND START AGAIN! (or something more nuanced 😂)

#### What bought you joy this week?

* reading and finding some cool "puzzle pieces" in the literature
  * KW: This is very cool! 
* after a few false starts, I got up on roller skates for a bit :rainbow:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* This week I will generate a landing page for the meetup - when that is done I would like a review in order to maintain alignment.
  * KW: Yes - sounds awesome - next week should work great for me to review / check.
    * Note to KW for memory - there may be text online that is out of date - good to make sure that isn't front an center on the project website 😂 🤦‍♀️ 
* a brainstorm for how to respond to an email from RR

#### Any other topics

* AgendaBot in meetings - are they helpful and should they come back this week?
  * KW: Check w LC, I don't think we need AgendaBot per se, but finding ways for you to participate with ease / sustainably is a high priority.
    If that's AgendaBot then that's fine with me 🤖
* Have been advised to take 4 weeks leave, do not feel it's possible to do so at this point but may take the remaining 2 weeks after the 30th.
