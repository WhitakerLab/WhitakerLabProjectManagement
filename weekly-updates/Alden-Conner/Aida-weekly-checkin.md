#### Who helped you this week?

AM, VH, MS, SG, AR, HM, HS, AB
  - [AM] I'm so glad everyone's been helpful and that you have reached out and joined lab coffee chats! Perhaps you'd like to think about some 1-2-1s with the people you'll be working with most closely - your call. Perhaps the daily lab coffee is enough.  

#### What did you achieve?

* (mostly) finished my 3 week objectives! 
  - [AM] WELL DONE!!!!! üéâüéâ   
* met a lot of people
  - [AM] Well done on managing all the trickiness of hybrid working and meeting people in their own 'spaces'.    

#### What did you struggle with?

* so much to learn/read/organize
  - [AM] Fully empathise. Let's discuss some specific solutions today.   

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* rubrics for SPARRA and COVID-19 modeling
  - [AM] That rubric is going to be so helpful to ALL of us (and future RAMs). ‚ú® Thank you for taking the lead on this.   

#### Where do you need help from Aida?

* Best way to organize project materials, eg links related to project, contact info, contact history
  - [AM] Fun discussion around Airtable vs Github Docs. Thanks so much for raising this for discussion - so so important! üôè
* review email to James et al
  - [AM] Happy to review, also happy for you to run with it. ‚ú®
* Discuss format for "worksheet"
  - [AM] Had a discussion about two different versions of the rubric: one word doc to be used for information consolisation and for decision-making by the RAM team; the second will be a worksheet in the style of the Open Canvas whose main purpose is to enable brainstorming sessions with the project team. The word doc version is more time-sensitive for us as a team, so let's work on that one first.üìÑ
