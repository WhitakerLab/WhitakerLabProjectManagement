AM, VH, MS, SG, AR, HM, HS, AB
  - [AM] I'm so glad everyone's been helpful and that you have reached out and joined lab coffee chats! Perhaps you'd like to think about some 1-2-1s with the people you'll be working with most closely - your call. Perhaps the daily lab coffee is enough.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

  - [AM] Happy to review, also happy for you to run with it. ‚ú®
* Discuss format for "worksheet"
  - [AM] Had a discussion about two different versions of the rubric: one word doc to be used for information consolisation and for decision-making by the RAM team; the second will be a worksheet in the style of the Open Canvas whose main purpose is to enable brainstorming sessions with the project team. The word doc version is more time-sensitive for us as a team, so let's work on that one first.üìÑ
