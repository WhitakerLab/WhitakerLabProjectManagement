### Date: 25 May 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* People from Public Policy (just a bit) and The Turing Way (also only a bit)

#### Who helped you this week?

* It was great to go through the new TREx form with GA for AUTSpaces!

#### What did you achieve?

* First half of the TREx Guidance is drafted (with an explanation for each principle). The next half is more prompts and an example response for each question (2/13 done)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Mini breakdown when, on Wednesday morning, rather than take time to prioritise what I ha to do, I just **did everything**, haha

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finish :clap: the :clap: first :clap: draft :clap: of :clap:TREx :clap: Guidance :clap: -- come on, Ismael!!!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I will speak with AM on Friday. If we have zero leads, I will ask about your network's connextions to the HRA!

#### Any other topics

* Second REC workshop on Thursday!!! 

---

### Date: 11 May 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* Week off! I helped nobody but me!
  * KW: :joy:

#### Who helped you this week?

* Week off! Probably video games. I forget how good they are at distracting me.
  * KW: üéÆüéÆüéÆ

#### What did you achieve?

* Had an eye test. My short-sightedness is worse now, so I will get new lenses.
  * KW: üëì

#### What did you struggle with?

* The person at the counter in the opticians broke my glasses' frame, so that was mildly stressful. They pulled through and found another frame my current lenses fit in for the timebeing.
  * KW: ü§®

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* All the things, some culminating, some still growing:
  * (i) EAG meeting on Tuesday hopefully leads to productive feedback for me to build on. The goal is to have the ethics form and framework to a good place by the end of the month.
    * KW: This is the #1 priority - great stuff üöÄ
  * (ii) RECs workshop will need building up to mentally on Wednesday!
    * KW: It's all looking good!
  * (iii) Meeting with researchers and CH on Tuesday to discuss a specific approach to research ethics that might be worth sharing with the EAG -- I see it as providing, at the very least, food for thought.
    * KW: FAB - excited for this!
  * (iv) Liaise with ASG PIs and researchers to discuss ethics forms.
    * KW: Great - really valuable work. Well done.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Give me a day or two and I'll have a clear question, haha

#### Any other topics

* I don't think so! Looooooooooooooooots going on!!!

---

### Date: 27 April 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* CR in PPP with stakeholder identification exercise
  * KW: Delighted that you're working with them!! :stars:

#### Who helped you this week?

* Had a lengthy chat with AM about maternity/parenthood that I thought was really helpful
* And thank you for joining the REC workshop meeting! 
  * KW: Well done you for coordinating everything!

#### What did you achieve?

* Meeting with ASG went well -- I will follow up on Wednesday
  * KW: OH WELL DONE!
* Met with SG and got the ethics form to a better place once again!
  * KW: I also asked AM to do an ethics application for the Data Availability extension work
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public
* Meeting with Health Programme people (have not yet met as I write this)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Pretty bad headache Tuesday and Wednesday -- eased off after turning the monitor off on Thursay, as the laptop screen is far better.
  * KW: Blurgh - I hope the new monitor makes a positive difference

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Three things (most to least effort, but all equally important): 
  * (i) REC workshops: review others' case studies and see how else I can help; 
  * (ii) keep working with CR on the PPP workbooks; and
  * (iii) prepare an agenda for the EAG meeting on 11 May (will need to reach out to VF).

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* We need a more united front, particularly re:
  * (i) scoping projects (I have been holding the position since I joined that we want to see ethics applications before they become detailed projects where they are scoping projects -- this was informally formalised at a PMU session [in December](https://hackmd.io/As56HwJSTm6KuNvNO12UcA?view#What-about-larger-projects)) and
    * KW: Agree - we need to be super clear on what is "scoping" as in literature review, thinking & planning vs "scoping" as in "doing pilot studies" where teams are working with data / writing code etc. The latter needs review.
  * (ii) other ethics boards (I do not think it is for us to decide what HRA do not want to see).
    * This means adding detail to the document Governance built for the T-REcs, at the least. What do you think?
    * KW: YES - I think you're right and I feel like I don't have good oversight of all of the different boards. HRA definitely feels like a very important start.

#### Any other topics

* Gentle reminder that I am off next week!
  * KW: Whaaaaaaat üòú Have a great rest üåÉ

### Date: 13 April 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* AS and NT with the Frankenstein ethics application!
  * KW: So fun!
* Everyone with my thoughts on data in data science!
  * KW: Love these posts :sparkles: 

#### Who helped you this week?

* MS helped me get a chapter up for review on The Turing Way: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1843/files?short_path=96095f9#diff-96095f9966fae011ca75e0c2c25ae49b5d3a1df8f6e8ab6011d24599a3747f8d
  * KW: WELL DONE! Thank you.
    * We talked in the meeting about mapping the new questions to this structure which doesn't have to work (don't force anything awkwardly!) but which might be helpful for folks filling in the form to see how the questions group together.

#### What did you achieve?

* All the ethics approvals! Three to be exact!
* The Frankenstein ethics application was made and sent to AS and NT
* Guidelines created for three of 13 of the new T-REcs questions
  * KW: ü¶ñ
* New post on diversity to discuss with AM: https://ismaelkg.medium.com/data-science-meaning-and-diversity-bb842602e55d
  * KW: Love this!
    * Could absolutely be worked up to a paper if you're interested!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Getting back to work after the long weekend was surprisingly hard! Tuesday was slooooooowwwwwwwwwwww
  * KW: OMG me too üò©

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Keep working on guidelines for the T-REcs form 2. I think these can be drafted by Friay 23rd.
  * KW: Great stuff!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* We're talking at the lab this week! Shall we prepare it during this meeting?
  * KW: YES! 
  * 10 minute presentation on the FAST principles then 10 minute breakout rooms on each of 4 groups of questions, then report outs üôå
    * Will be fascinating!

#### Any other topics

* Hm, I am spending a little time between tasks to think about my role and the EAG.

---

### Date: 16 March 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* AM! We ha our second mentoring session -- still figuring out how to get a folder setup on Github (at time of writing). But we will be scoping how RAMs can spread The Good Word of the EAG.

#### Who helped you this week?

* CB was helpful on the research ethics front, reminding me of what was done for DECOVID; also interested in sharing on the Turing Blog about partiucipatory science; and interested in helping write a paper (I still need to hear back from GA an SF).

#### What did you achieve?

* Got a nifty new ethics form to a decent place based on DL's FAST principles.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Getting EAG reviews done...

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I will have a think about case studies before meeting with AS and NT on Thursday

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Have we heard back about the Turing-wide ethics review?

#### Any other topics

* I am using this space to remind you oooooooooooooooooooooooof (as you wrote last time we met!):
  * KW: I'd love to brainstorm an academic paper that accompanies all the T-REx work that we've been working on.
Please remind me about that!! üôè

---

### Date: 16 March 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* I want to say AutSPACES, even if just a bit.
  I joined the call on Thursday and helped two participants take notes.
  Hearing directly from them was also really helpful for me.
  * KW: Definitely counts!
    Super helpful!
* I am also helping with enrichment scheme recruitment.
  I forgot I signed up for this ages ago and casually accepted without telling you...
  * KW: Very supportive - selecting the next generation of data scientistis is very helpful! üåü

#### Who helped you this week?

* Oh, go on: KW, of course! Mostly because of how you defended the interests of the EAG when discussing process. Oh, and getting me to work full-time!
  * KW: DELIGHTED!! My almost year long campaign has finally come to fruition üòú
* KW and SG with getting my head around Zenodo and DOIs!

#### What did you achieve?

* Presentation with GA an SF -- saved here [10.5281/zenodo.4603091](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4603091) for posterity!
* Two (long! useful!) design meetings for EAG processes.
* A few more applications in the pipeline.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Probably getting the presentation across the finish line.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I have reviewed the JD -- the "latest" one is the one you emailed me February last year!
  * KW: All surprisingly good!
  * Missing TPS, but that's understandable, can be added ‚úîÔ∏è
  * Mising Governance team as key stakeholder, also articulation of broader landscape (although that's a bit hard!)
  * Missing customised training requirements - internal and potentially external.
  * Missing research element - not there for defensive recruiting reasons... could come back in for a specific candidate though ‚úîÔ∏è 
* The [values](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/workbook-art-pics-glossary/) are, I think:
  * _Integrity_ (big word I think is necessary for a role dealing with what can be tricky conversations),
    * KW: Has an element of embracing nuance but not being pivoted away as a result of specific project information & context.
    * We also discussed how this relates to a value of _consistency_ which I think is really aligned.
  * _Openness_ (which I think conveys the transparency with which we need to work) and 
    * KW: Agree that I think we don't make enough of this at the moment but it _is_ the core vision üíô
    * This is also our link to _The Turing Way_ and participatory research quite broadly.
  * _Stewardship_ (because there is a need to articulate and defend the need for T-REx, but also to guide conversations in constructive directions -- if I am reading the term correctly!).
    * KW: Interestingly one of the same values as community managers - which I think is 100% right.  

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I have more time now!
  The immediate thing I can fill that time with is _The Turing Way_, but please tell me how things are progressing "higher up" when it comes to T-REx.

#### Any other topics

KW: I'd love to brainstorm an academic paper that accompanies all the T-REx work that we've been working on.
Please remind me about that!! üôè

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I have put together some [very simple guidelines](https://hackmd.io/DneAaMlYSnaPlsHqzskwDQ) for filling out the form as it currently is, for the purpose of *The Turing Way*.
  * Could you take a look or help me find people who could review?
  * KW: Looks REALLY GOOD!
    * Suggestions for reviewers: JC, MBr, GB, JM  - key prompt is "is this too vague?"

#### Any other topics

* Ethics Committees workshop -- I would like to get more involved...
  * KW: Super supportive of this!
    * **Who are the audience, and what do they need to read to want to come to the event?**
    * Can you have a brainstorm with AM, AB, and (maybe?) the Turing events team to see where your _gaps_ in answering this question currently are.
      Once you know the gaps you can feed those back (google doc) to the organising team.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finalise and record ethics workshop video for the PMU
  
#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Can we pick up the ethics-at-the-Turing paper again?

#### Any other topics

* I don't think so! I need to clarify on the ethics form what NHS and Ministry-of-Defence ethics reviews in-lieu-of-ours means

---

### Date: 27 October 2020

---

### Date: 06 October 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* Classmates with finding hard-to-find papers we are meant to read!
  * KW: YES! Have you heard of http://unpaywall.org

#### Who helped you this week?

* FN and KX with the tech talk, you with my Thursday!

---

### Date: 29 September 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped a colleague by saying to just take an afternoon off after they'd had very difficult meetings throughout the day!
  * KW: I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

#### Who helped you this week?

* YH and LC were great to hang out with on Friday, and that was really helpful!
  * KW: Such great people :sparkling_heart:

#### What did you achieve?

* Yet another awesome meeting with MB!
  * KW: Oh this is such a joy :star2:

#### What did you struggle with?

* I've been a bit distracted with class starting just around the corner (Monday 28th being the first day).
  * Oh, and this is fun: I've been put in a Saturday slot for dissertation seminars!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I need to check the new ethics form for references to legal aspects covered by the DPAP (I think I took them out already, but will have a look) 
  * KW: Great.
* The email from RE has reignited the need for ethical guidance. I want to suggest a compilation of resources. Some universities do this: a page with links to frameworks that researchers can work with. Of course [DL's report](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-06/understanding_artificial_intelligence_ethics_and_safety.pdf) is the best for AI in public policy, but we've also learned of an excellent [framework BV has used for researchers working on hate speech](https://www.thorn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/EmployeeResilienceGuidebookFinal7-13-1.pdf). And there are so many more. Oxford have a page similar to [this idea](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/ethics/resources/guidance#collapse394976). We can then make it mandatory for applicants to share what framework they will follow and how.
  * KW: Strong yes on this front, Emma will be a good ally in this work.
  
#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I would really appreciate it if you finalise the ethics form with regard to the data safe haven questions -- I tried to comment on each question with where they are referenced in other sections
  * KW: Please put a 2 hour slot in my calendar for me to work on this (with 30 mins of you turning up at the end as my accountability check!)

#### Any other topics

* Not yet! I am meeting with my dissertation supervisor on Wednesday at 4 and will hopefully have the beginnings of a plan set out by the end of the week!
  * KW: Super exciting!
 * KW: Can you have a think about a submission to https://nbiair.com/#CFP - ideally including CH and VF if they're interested.

### Date: 22 September 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped MS by giving the Turing Way newsletter a proof read! SB helped too!
  * KW: Thank you! :pray:

#### Who helped you this week?

* LC and I worked on some OLS-2 homework - I feel like we helped each other (SB made it last Friday and we all worked together then).
  * KW: Double wonderful!

#### What did you achieve?

* Another EAG form through the finish line!
  * There was a personal information sheet missing and which our reviewer wanted to see before approving.
    The PI was really open to EAG's views.
* I've got the EAG document to a place where I think it can be shared for further comments from others.

#### What did you struggle with?

* My birthday coming up always gets me a bit feisty, haha

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* VF asked to have a look at what other institutions' ethics committees ask about/do.
  * I've briefly checked a few.
  * Oxford have something similar to what we thought we could develop.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I know presentations are a big thing in this world, but what else might work?
  * Videos?
  * I'm thinking videos again...
  * KW: Love these ideas - have a chat with Georgia too and brainstorm what works. I bet Yo might have some good ideas too!

#### Any other topics

* The OLS programme is really exciting with LC and SB!

---

### Date: 08 September 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped with 4 (or 5?) different ethics applications, including one from all the way back in January!
 * KW: ROCK STAR! Great stuff!

#### Who helped you this week?

* MN and I had a chat and she helped by giving me a lot of names of different people around the institute to speak with about embedding ethics in our research culture.
  * KW: Ah, very very cool :star2:

#### What did you achieve?

* I got both DSG ethics form across the finish line (just in time!)
  * KW: So important - thank you!
* I don't know if this is an achievement exactly, but learning about Governance's Data Protection Assessment Plan was a nice surprise!
  * KW: :muscle::muscle::muscle:

#### What did you struggle with?

* To discuss in the meeting

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Having spoken with JC on 03-Sep, I want to finish off the first draft of the paper presenting the EAG for your talk.
  * KW: It's looking great - excited for the next version.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* An idea that has been shared by several EAGers is that we could have a live document with past recommendations made to researchers so PIs can turn to it when in doubt and EAG can develop a series of best practices.
  * Could such a thing live on The Turing Way, or maybe The Turing Way can link back to this more or less live document?
  * KW: Lets make the document first and use it internally for a while to see how it goes.

#### Who did you help this week?

* Over the past week, I helped the DSSG folks with the ethical research workshop!
  * KW: You did such a great job!
* I also helped PH (I think!) by doing some DMPOnline testing

#### Who helped you this week?

* You saved the day by making a Zoom room that worked for the DSSG training!
  * KW: Aaaaah my many talents!!

#### What did you achieve?

* The DSSG ethics training was a big thing for me!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Suddenly, we got three EAG forms over the weekend and I think the reviewers are at capacity.
  Also, there are the summer holidays, so this might be a larger struggle.
  * KW: Discussed in person - just keep asking politely 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Chatting with MF and MN on Thursday about delivering more training.
  I think I like the idea of working on that some more!
  * KW: Fab!
* I'm also giving the EAG folders and excel document a review for tidiness!
  * KW: GREAT IDEA!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Who could I work with on writing a post for the Turing blog about research ethics?
  I guess the thesis of that blog would be: ethical reflection is critical to the scientific method.
  But I'd love to bounce ideas around.

#### Any other topics

* None at the moment!

KW: Really good conversation about building engagement and cohesion at the Turing!!
Keep up the great work :space_invader: :star2:
   
### Date: 17 June 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped MS word the new Ethics intro page for The Turing Way: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/jupyterbook-restructure/book/website/ethical-research/ethical-research.md
  * KW: YEAH!

#### Who helped you this week?

* MS and LC helped me write the blog post for Data Feminism! (And the authors had a look too, which is awesome!)
  * KW: SO FREAKING COOL! :hibiscus: :muscle:
  * Just a couple of notes about the start and finish - really tiny changes - the whole post reads really well - well done! :sparkles:

* Got some feedback on application form from EAG members
* Wrote Data Feminism blog post

#### What did you struggle with?

* Long story, something about a poorly worded survey question (not to do with work)
  * KW: Solidarity. Sounds like a super stressful week.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I am seeing different standards in ethics reviews -- or at least varying degrees of specificity in what is required from applicants... With my customer service and administrator hats on, I feel guidance must be made available to reviewers, so that expectations are clear... Can I work on setting this idea?
  * YES PLEASE :heart_eyes:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* It would be great to hear back on the ethics form and the integration of the Safe Haven questions
  * KW: SOB - I'm so sorry I'm so slow. YES. I will do this.

#### Any other topics

* Flexi-Grant finally does the job right! SO MANY OPTIONS TO TOGGLE.

* A bit with understanding how the safe haven will fit with the EAG process -- I feel the integration, whatever it looks like, will be more long-term

* Finalise new EAG form; maybe content for EAG video?
* KW: Start thinking about guidance? To go with the form & to be featured in the video :joy: 
* KW: Connect with safe haven folks about building either a public form separated from the data, or translating the classification questions into flexigrant

KW: Generally I think this is a good week to probably consolidate some of the information that you've been gathering over the last month. All going in a great direction though!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Data Safe Haven! (In general terms)
  * KW: Thank you so much for demoing this!!

* The training wheels are coming off and I think I just need general reassurance =)
  * KW: AS ABOVE. GREAT WORK.
