### Nomura (for LGBT History Month)

**Date**: 13 February 2019

**Title**: Alan Turing: Life and Legacy

**Abstract**: In celebration of LGBT History Month 2019, I will give a brief overview of the life of Alan Turing and discuss the legacy of a gay man who shortened World War II by two years (or more) before dying by suicide aged 41.
Voted the [most iconic scientist](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5jQ6817N7QWTz5bJJspyDNy/alan-turing) of the 20th century in a recent [BBC TV series](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0by86tp), Turing designed the first "universal computing machine" and the "Turing Test", two fundamental building blocks of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
Today, researchers at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) are carrying his legacy forward through their innovative and interdisciplinary solutions to data driven questions.
I will explain why technology must be built by diverse and inclusive communities, and the pitfalls that come from homogeneous groups of developers.
Although homosexuality is no longer illegal in the UK, we still need better representation of LGBTQ+ people in data science and artificial intelligence.
Invoking Turing's early death, I will encourage all members of the audience to reflect on their communities:
Whose voices are we not hearing?
Whose expertise have we lost?
How do we ensure that future Turings can meet their greatest potential?

**Application website**: https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/Scopingworkshopturing

**Date**: Submitted on 18 Feb 2019

*Questions not answered here*: Transparency agreement, contact details, GDPR consent to share contact information

**Current organisation**: Alan Turing Institute (research fellow) and University of Cambridge (senior research associate)

**URL of your Personal Webpage**: https://whitakerlab.github.io

*No CV uploaded as personal webpage exists*

**Career stage**: Mid (I'm not very clear about this, but early seems a bit of a stretch?)

**What is your personal motivation to attend and what do you think you’ll bring to the workshop?**

I applied to join the Turing as a research fellow in 2016 because it looked like an institute that could affect real change in how we do academic research at scale.
Its goal is to bring together people from different disciplines to produce impactful work that no individual would be able to conduct alone.
I am delighted that it is investing in the tools, systems and practices that are needed to make this ambition a reality.
I am particularly interested in the incentive structures, pedagogical requirements and interpersonal skills that facilitate participation in collaborative and open science practices.
Open science includes sharing data (which can be FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, without necessarily being open), sharing code, participatory research with citizen and community scientists, making all research outputs open access, and building open educational resources.
In the first year of TSP funding I have lead "The Turing Way" project (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
Our interdisciplinary team of research software engineers, librarians, neuroscientists, data scientists and physicists are writing a handbook for reproducible research.
It includes chapters on version control, research data management, testing and continuous integration for research (among others), along with case studies and stories from data scientists trying to make their work reproducible "in the wild".
At the tools, systems and practices scoping workshop, I would like to present the progress we have made so far, and to see how we can integrate the knowledge and skills in the room (and beyond) into the Turing Way going forwards.
I will bring to the workshop an intersectional feminist perspective on using openness as a vehicle for justice.
In particular, I will contribute to building connections between people, projects and ideas.
I hope to collaboratively build a programme of work that is equitable and ethical, and that empowers data scientists around the world to make a positive impact by working together and for the benefit of all.

**Travel and accommodation funding requirements**: Return train from London to Cambridge (approx £50) and 1 night accommodation on 21 March (approx £150).

> Slides for that talk at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7819442

**Date**: 7 & 8 March 2019

**Title**: Harnessing the power of participatory citizen science to share autistic people's experiences at scale

**Abstract**: [Autistica](https://www.autistica.org.uk/) and the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) are working together to build a participatory, citizen science platform to gather data on how sensory processing affects autistic people’s navigation of the world.
Numerous studies have confirmed that autistic people experience sensory processing differences, and that this can significantly impact their lives.
One aspect which is not yet fully understood is how these differences affect the ways in which autistic people navigate different environments.
In this talk, I will showcase the team's process of building a project that is participatory from the ground up.
We ensure that all aspects of the project are designed and developed in collaboration with members of the autistic community.
The platform will be developed under a free and open source license and we commit to making all software,design and process documents open from the beginning.
I will share our progress in building and providing citizen scientists with a fine-grained consent model that supports individual contributor’s personal preferences on how their data is used on the platform.
Flipping the traditional scientific study on its head, our goal is to give a voice to the autistic citizen scientists and educate neurotypical people.
We seek to empower everyone in supporting autistic people and their families in living long, healthy, happy lives.

### ESRC workshop on open science in Lancaster

**Website**: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/future-proofing-your-research-moving-towards-open-reproducible-research-tickets-60575376582

**Date**: 4 June 2019

**Title**: The Turing Way: A how to guide for reproducible research

**Abstract**: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code.
The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work.
This is sometimes easier said than done!
Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.
*The Turing Way* is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is "too easy not to do".
It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, and open and transparent communication with future users, and includes case studies and common "gotchas" for researchers to avoid.
This project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of *The Turing Way*, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations you can use and re-use for your own research, and the directions in which we're continuing to develop.
All participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work reproducible, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can contribute to improve *The Turing Way* for future readers.

### INCF Congress on Neuroinformatics

This is a keynote presentation in the *Building Open Science Communities: Social engineering aspects of Standards and Best Practices* session.

**Website**: http://www.neuroinformatics2019.org

**Date**: 1 & 2 September 2019

**Title**: 10 simple rules for running an open and inclusive projects online

**Abstract:** There are many reasons why open source projects have difficulty attracting contributors.
Current academic incentive structures are some of the strongest.
Wanting to maintain a competitive advantage, too great a focus on novelty when publishing papers, and too little credit given to writing documentation and tutorials, all encourage researchers to reinvent the wheel in a closed team.
Although I will discuss these barriers, my talk will focus on some challenges that are much easier to overcome.
Not knowing where to start.
"Imposter syndrome" and the various intersecting biases that accompany (and often underpin) it.
Being unsure as to whether a project even wants any contributions.
These can all be addressed with 10 simple rules.
From laying out your welcome mat, through setting explicit expectations, to the graceful death of your project, these steps will will help you build and run an open and inclusive community-driven project online.

### MQ Data Science Meeting

**Website**: https://www.epay.ed.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/college-of-medicine-and-veterinary-medicine/school-of-molecular-and-clinical-medicine/division-of-psychiatry/mq-mental-health-data-science-meeting-2019

**Date**: 9 September 2019

**Title**: The Turing Way: A handbook for reproducible research

**Abstract**: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code.
The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work.
This is sometimes easier said than done!
Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.
*The Turing Way* is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is "too easy not to do".
It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, and open and transparent communication with future users, and includes case studies and common "gotchas" for researchers to avoid.
This project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of *The Turing Way*, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations you can use and re-use for your own research, and the directions in which we're continuing to develop.
All participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work reproducible, even in situations where data can not be made publicly available, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can contribute to improve *The Turing Way* for future readers.

### Port Talk at Goodenough College

**Website**: *Insert link*

**Date**: 29 October 2019

**Title**: Misaligned incentives in academia: working together within a broken system

**Abstract**: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
By sharing data, analysis code and the computational environment used to generate the results, researchers can more effectively stand on the shoulders of their peers and colleagues and deliver high quality, trustworthy and verifiable outputs.
This requires skills in data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.
Skills that are unreasonable, in fact, to expect in one individual team member.
Even worse, they are not sufficient for ethical, transparent, collaborative, participatory and well designed data science!
In this after dinner Port Talk I will discuss the challenges of working collaboratively in the current academic incentive system, and give concrete advice on how early career researchers can access knowledge and support to incrementally change that system from within.
All participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work reproducible, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can improve academic research to deliver on its most impactful promise.

**Title**: Participatory citizen science to improve autistic people's lives

**Abstract**: [Autistica](https://www.autistica.org.uk/) and the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) are working together to build a participatory, citizen science platform to gather data on how sensory processing affects autistic people’s navigation of the world.
Numerous studies have confirmed that autistic people experience sensory processing differences, and that this can significantly impact their lives.
One aspect which is not yet fully understood is how these differences affect the ways in which autistic people navigate different environments.
In this talk, I will showcase the team's process of building a project that is participatory from the ground up.
We ensure that all aspects of the project are designed and developed in collaboration with members of the autistic community.
In close collaborations with the [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/about/) community, we are developing a platform for which the software, design, process and governance documentation are all open source.
I will share our progress in building and providing citizen scientists with a fine-grained consent model that supports individual contributor's personal preferences on how their data is used on the platform.
Flipping the traditional scientific study on its head, our goal is to give a voice to the autistic citizen scientists and educate neurotypical people.
We seek to empower everyone in supporting autistic people and their families in living long, healthy, happy lives.
Audience members will leave knowing how they can join the team and contribute to the project that same day, starting from information at [our website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience), or reuse the processes we've developed for their own citizen science research.

### Inspirational Seminars talk at EMBL

**Website**: *insert link*

**Date**: 8 November 2019

**Title**: I have no idea what I'm doing: open and transparent leadership in academia

**Abstract**: We know everyone's story is curated.
It's one of the most important aspects of self care: to remember that people don't post on social media their mediocre days or achievements!
But telling stories are also powerful ways to affect change.
To connect with people and create a richer tapestry of experiences to inspire and empower a diverse community of researchers.
In this talk I will describe my journey from Physics, to Neuroscience, to Data Science.
I'll thread my personal experiences of dancing, skiing, cycling, networking and activism through what looks - after the fact - like a well planned 18 years since leaving high school.
I will finish with some visions of ethical, transparent and collaborative working in the future of academic research.
