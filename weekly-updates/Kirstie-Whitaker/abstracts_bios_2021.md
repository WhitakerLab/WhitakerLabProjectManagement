# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of all the talk abstracts and bios I write for events or projects in 2021.

Hopefully I'll be able to re-use at least some of them ;)

They're ordered by date of presentation / submission so ideally they're a little easier to find.

### University of Florida: Rigor and Reproducibility Seminar Series

**Website**: https://uf-repro.github.io/movementdisorders-seminar

**Date**: 12 Feburary 2021

**Title**: The Turing Way: Empowering researchers in reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative science

**Abstract**: Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of The Turing Way, will take you on a whirlwind tour of this resource that supports students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is "too easy not to do".
By sharing data, analysis code and the computational environment used to generate the results, researchers can more effectively stand on the shoulders of their peers and colleagues and deliver high quality, trustworthy and verifiable outputs.

Although reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted, it requires skills in data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.
Beyond these skills lie the structural and incentive barriers to working open.
All participants will leave the talk understanding the many dimensions of openness and how they can participate in an inclusive, supportive, kind and inspiring open source ecosystem as they seek to improve research culture, making it "open for all".

The Turing Way is an openly developed project with training material on version control, analysis testing, collaborating in distributed groups, open and transparent communication skills, and effective management of diverse research projects.
Any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker leads the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) (London, UK).
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions.
Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues.
She is the lead developer of [_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.
She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a [2016/17 Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab).
Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://2016globalthinkers.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine. You can find more information at her lab website: [whitakerlab.github.io](https://whitakerlab.github.io).
