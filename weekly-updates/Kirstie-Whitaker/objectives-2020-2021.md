> :point_right: Build resilience into our operating model and funding sources.

I was successfully awarded the --- grant in April 2021.
I will lead a diverse team of 8 co-investigators (including myself), half of whom are women.
I have built trust with collaborators across five institutes (Edinburgh, MRC Harwell, Swansea & Turing), and with stakeholders at the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health and Social Care.

Our work will build a firm foundation for TPS' investment in:

1. Reproducible compuational environments - providing a force multiplier connection with the Turing's Data Safe Haven.
2. Accessible research ready data standards - building on work with the MRC Harwell Data Wrangling team who have contributed to DECOVID, EDoN Analytics Hub and the Joint Biosecurity Centre
3. Community engagement and training - implementing and extending the work of The Turing Way, REG Open Source service area and Data Study Groups.
4. Patient and public involvement and engagement - strengthening and deepening work with that ethics team within the Public Policy Programme started during the DECOVID project.
5. Sustainability and legacy - extending the Research Application Manager team created as part of the AI for Science and Government investment.

The purpose of the AIM RSF significantly overlaps with Turing's partnership with the National Air Traffic Services.
One co-investigator will work across both projects (Gabasova) and I am in close contact with Turing-NATS principal investigator Tim Dodwell.
The design of the research support facility has been re-used in a partnership proposal with Genomics England.

We are currently negotiating the contract, with support from Katrina Payne and Darren Grey in the Partnerships team.
Job descriptions are prepared for a Programme Manager and a Research Project Manager to be posted as soon as the contract is signed.
Flow downs to the collaborating institutions will be developed in July 2021.
Projected timeline is to ramp up the research support facility in September 2021.

2. Deliver TPS theme of AI for Science and Government.
    1. Contribute to midterm review in written format (November 2020), participating in the interview sessions (January 2021) and supporting the design of the event (August 2020 - January 2021) to best showcase coherent ASG outputs across the investment.
    2. Take responsibility for the delivery of the programme as a member of the programme management board (regular meetings through the year).
    3. Develop a new role of "Research Application Manager" (RAM) and recruit three members of staff to connect researchers and stakeholders in the AI for Science and Government programme and the broader Turing and open research communities.

I have been an engaged and enthusiastic member of the ASG Management Board since January 2020.
I worked with Alan Wilson, Allaine Cerwonka and Harriet McCann to deliver an engaging midterm review that was passed with constructive feedback from the review panel.
I wrote the TPS sections of the final report and was individually interviewed by the panel during the two day review.
Four TPS projects - NoCell, QUIPP, Raphtory and The Turing Way - created video recording submissions to demonstrate the impact of our work to improve AI for Science and Government.
During the panel TPS received particularly positive comments on our engagement with clinicians through the DECOVID project and our support of early career researchers through The Turing Way community.

Through the last year I have delivered regular project updates and advocated on behalf of both TPS specific projects and ASG wide projects to keep the investment focused on its responsibility to deliver a coherent body of work.
I am a collaborator within the Shocks and Resilience Cross Theme Project and the Environmental Sensors project within the Environment and Sustainability Cross Theme Project.
I am an active participant in regular design and programme management meetings, provide additional mentorship for one of the postdoctoral researchers (Alejandro Coca Castro), along with strategic support.
I am particularly enjoying working with Dr Scott Hoskings within the

I line manage Aida Mehonic as the first Research Application Manager (RAM).
Aida spent her first two months (Jan & Feb 2021) working 50% on ASG (the other 50% on her previous role as Programme Manager for the AI Programme).
She has been full time on ASG since March 2021.
We have scoped and deepened the role definition of a RAM resulting in three a new job description.
We particularly invested in co-creation of this role and developing buy-in from across the domain specific themes of ASG.
The job posts are currently open (https://cezanneondemand.intervieweb.it/turing/jobs/research_application_manager_x2_14360), closing on 20 June 2021.
They are proving to be very popular and I am confident that we will build a strong team that will be the foundation of TPS' investment in ensuring that open source software, datasets and trained models are usable and used across industry, government and the third sector.
Aida and I are excited about two projects that have already significantly benefited from our involvement: a generalisable computer vision tool from the Data Science for Science team and engagement with the Department for Work and Pensions to deploy their version of the Turing's Data Safe Haven.
We also look forward to building the user base of equadratures (https://equadratures.org), an open-source python toolkit for digital twin modelling that is tailored for uncertainty quantification, surrogate-based optimisation, numerical integration, and data-driven dimension reduction.

In the last two months I have also been deeply engaged with new ASG Director Ben MacArthur to design the delivery of a series of opinionated white papers targetted at stakeholders such as civil servants, clinicians, industry data scientists, and members of the public.
We have written a job description for a community manager who will work with Malvika Sharan to support ASG to deliver work that is "greater than the sum of its parts".
Under my leadership ASG investment is set to leave TPS with two specialist teams for open source community management and research application management - led by Malvika and Aida respectively - which will significantly improve our capacity to collaborate across Turing research programmes and projects.

3. Deliver ... research publications from the ... project covering specific research questions on ... COVID19 .... [Details removed]

> :point_right: Solve national and international challenges

Although DECOVID has not delivered its publications I note that I have achieved all of the sub-bullet points to a high standard.
I task manage community and project managers, including three Engage at Turing students, and coordinate the work of five research teams.
I have maintained a focus on rewarding collaborative working and emphasising reproducible and ethical research reporting.
I set strategic direction for the project, including a pivot in April 2021 to ensure the delivery of DECOVID data for future use.

DECOVID has been featured in the Turing's report on Data Science contributions to understanding COVID19 and in the Turing's Annual Report.
It has spawned research collaborations with UCLH (QUIPP) and work on responsibile research and innovation will likely be supported by AI for Science and Government as part of their white paper series.
University Hospital Birmingham are a funded project as part of the AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions (AIM) investment so knowledge of their data practices and DECOVID's investment into the Pioneer platform will be valuable for effective collaboration as part of the AIM RSF.
I have also engaged with the OMOP data standard development community, taking forward TPS's strategic direction to invest in ineroperable data standards
At least three members of the DECOVID executive committee have fed into the Goldacre Review.

I consider my work on DECOVID to be a significant risk mitigation for the Turing Institute.
The research teams are committed to delivering their analysis papers.
I am hopeful that by the end of 2021 there will be data available for others to reuse that we can point to as a concrete output.
I am confident that I have learned from the mistakes made within the DECOVID project.
Much of the AIM RSF and DSH strategy has been designed to avoid similar pitfalls.

4. Develop national and international expertise in reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science as lead investigator of The Turing Way project.
    1. Scale the adoption of open source practices through participation in the Google Season of Docs and Google Summer of Code, and mentorship of Turing research teams through the Open Life Science training programme. Source additional funding to expand the project delivery and leadership team.
    2. Line manage, mentor and support postdoctoral researcher Malvika Sharan in writing 50 new chapters and welcoming 150 new contributors to the open source book project. Attend regular co-working sessions to onboard new members from universities around the world, government offices, industry partners, and the third sector.
    3. Present - or mentor others in presenting - the project at international conferences such as NeurIPS, CogX, Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop and AIUK.

The Turing Way project goes from strength to strength.
We have users in government, academia and industry.
In March 2021 the book had around 5000 visitors, consisting of around 150 unique visits per day.
Our community includes contributions from more than 300 people.
Our Google Season of Docs student (Paul Owoicho) developed a style guide, chapter templates, and meeting accessibility requirements.
Members of the project team have presented at around 50 events in the last year.
We have been cited by around 15 academic publications, 20 blog posts, and 30 presentations.

Four open source projects are building on the project model developed and practiced by The Turing Way:
* UK Government Analytical Community. (2020). Quality assurance of code for analysis and research (version 2021.3). Office for National Statistics, Best Practice and Impact division: https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/
* A Citizen Science Guide for Research Libraries, From the LIBER Citizen Science Working Group. https://github.com/CitSci-WG/guide.
* Turing Data Stories. Beavan, D., Rangel Smith, C., Van Stroud, S. and Xu K. Turing Data Stories, 2020. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TuringDataStories.
* FAIR Cookbook, https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook, Rocca-Serra, P. (University of Oxford) Sansone, S. A., (University of Oxford) Splendiani, A., (Novartis) Giessman, R. (Bayer AG) and FAIRplus Consortium Members

Members of The Turing Way community have provided trainings for Turing Data Study Groups, Doctoral Training Programmes across the UK, and AI for Science and Government postdoctoral researchers.
We have worked closely with the Turing's Training team and look forward to engaging with Ben Murton in his new role as Head of Skills.
Open research and digital skills training are a core strategic mechanism for TPS.

The Binder Federation (https://mybinder.org) is a series of BinderHubs (https://jupyter.org/binder) around the world providing free and public computational resources in the cloud to run and share reproducible analyses across all domains of data science.
One such BinderHub is supported by the Azure credits provided by the Turing Institute and The Turing Way project.
Investment in the Jupyter represents a strategic engagement for the TPS programme.

5. Meet the highest standards of collaborative ethical review for cutting edge data science projects through the Turing Turing Ethics Advisory Group to ensure the Turing is delivering on its responsibilities as a charitable organisation, and mitigating risks for the Institute.
    1. Implement responsive, collaborative feedback process for fast paced project development such as ... by May 2020, two months after the start of the COVID19 global pandemic.
    2. Chair ongoing regular meetings of the Ethics Advisory Group (every 2 months), emergency review meetings (ad hoc basis), and coordinate activities with members of the broader Turing ... community.
    3. Line manage, mentor and support a new ethics research assistant (joined Institute in May 2020) who will be responsible for managing ethics review requests, coordinating regular meetings of the ethics advisory group, and supporting ... teams in understanding their role in the application process.

> :point_right: National aim: Be innovative to always add value

Ismael Kherroubi Garcia and I have worked extensively with General Counsel Vanessa Forster to build the Turing's ethics review process from the ground up.
The result is the Turing Research Ethics Committee which is clearly integrated into the Institute's Governance and Legal structures.
We have modularised data protection considerations, meaning that researchers are not asked the same questions twice through legal and ethics review processes.

The new process is built around the FAST (Fairness, Accountability, Sustainability, and Transparency) principles laid out by David Leslie in the Turing's 2020 report "Understanding artificial intelligence ethics and safety: A guide for the responsible design and implementation of AI systems in the public sector".
Our work means that the Turing is "eating its own dog food": internal review processes will conform to advice that our Public Policy Programme recommend for government.

The new process will be released over summer 2021 and potentially launched at the same time as a report into Research Ethics Committee in academia, government and industry led by the Ada Lovelace Institute.
Ismael and I have supported the design and delivery of two invite only workshops on research ethics review processes that will be captured in the report by the end of 2021.
We developed case studies to stimulate discussion and I gave a keynote presentation on a "DevOps approach" for ethics review.

Our "business as usual" review process is continuing with very positive feedback across the board.
We are increasing in our number of applications due to strategic and consistent advocacy across all business teams at the Turing Institute.
I have mentored Ismael to deliver ethics application trainings for programme management, partnership and data study group teams.
We manage expectations well and are not afraid to broker difficult conversations when ambitious and risky projects are brought to us for consideration.

6. Build and engage the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme community.
    1. Recruit a TPS research project manager who will be responsible for coordinating expertise across TPS funded projects (November 2020).
    2. Host regular coffee chats (weekly, starting in January 2021), seminars (monthly, starting in May 2020), office hours (weekly, starting in February 2021) and engage the TPS community through Slack (daily, starting in May 2020). Advertise these events to as wide an audience as possible through newsletters (monthly, started in May 2020).
    3. Present to the broader Turing community at a Programme Research Showcase in January 2021.

> :point_right: National aim: Ensure the Turing feels and is inclusive

The TPS Programme has delivered a successful series of events and seminars which regularly attract 20-40 attendees both internal and external to the Turing, including the January Programme Showcase.
We have built a strong connection with the Facilitating Responsible Participation in Data Science interest group and are developing shared directions with the Visualisation interest group.

We are active on the Turing's slack workspace in the #tps and #ethics-advisory-group channels.
We have made particular investment in welcoming the Engage at Turing students and new postdoctoral researchers working within the the AI for Science and Government.
Our weekly coffee chats (Thursdays at 2:30pm) are well attended and serve as an "water cooler" for conversations and finding solutions for researchers across the Institute.
We send monthly newsletters that contain opportunities of interest to a very broad community across the Turing Institute and university and strategic partner organisations.

Highlights from the TPS Q3 & Q4 report:
* Raphtory project team impact story: https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/just-add-time-dizzying-potential-dynamic-graphs
* WAYS project has released the initial findings from user research: https://figshare.com/articles/presentation/How_do_Data_Scientists_Create_Data_Visualisations_Workflows_Experiences_and_Perceptions_when_visualising_data_with_R/14112635
* The Turing contribution to the Binder Federation (https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/federation.html) had 461,349 launches in 2020 for more than 3,000 GitHub projects. Some noteworthy projects on GitHub that use Binder to teach Python programming and machine learning are 'ipython/ipython-in-depth' (205744 launches), 'jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo' (141108 launches) and Scikit-learn (2352 launches).
* The Turing Online Training grant for £10,000 was jointly awarded to Open Life Science and The Turing Way to support their collaboration "OLS for Turing".
* Graduate student Markus Löning was awarded $5,000 from the Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools (JROST) rapid-response fund announced during the JROST 2020 conference in December 2020.
* In March, the QUIPP team co-led the scoping for one of the workstreams in the Turing Data Study Groups which is held in April. The work uses datasets from the Department for Work and Pensions, aiming to understand which utility metrics are appropriate for particular applications that use these datasets.
* Data Safe Havens project has conducted extensive outreach and discussions with external stakeholders from strategic partners, government and non-profit organisations.
* The Turing Way Book Dash in November hosted 20 international participants, in parallel with BioHackathon-EU 2020.
* We formally welcomed 4 Turing Fellow projects to the Tools, Practices & Systems programme.

I am very proud of the investment that Arielle Bennett (TPS Research Project Manager) and I have made into building the TPS community since January 2021.
She and I have developed a call to expand the TPS leadership team in 2021 with the following goals:
* Accountability: Transparency is a core value both for the Turing and TPS. An expanded leadership team will help decision making to be more accountable. It will also be important to bring in multiple perspectives across domain and discipline expertise to offer diverse viewpoints on open science and infrastructure
* Scalability: An expanded leadership team will extend the capabilities of the programme to reach into open infrastructure communities and maximise the impact of programme investment and collaborations.
* Connectivity: The interconnectedness of the leadership team will improve efficiency of the programme, ensuring it is not trying to "reinvent the wheel" across different projects and communities.

This process has been slower than I had expected, but it has had deep engagement with leadership of the programme management unit, the people team, and the final version is being reviewed by an external HR lawyer.
I am confident that this process will be re-usable across Turing research programmes and will therefore improve cohesion and scalability at a senior researcher level across the Institute.
