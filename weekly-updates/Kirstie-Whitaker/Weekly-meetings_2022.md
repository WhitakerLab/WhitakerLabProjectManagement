### What brought you joy this week?

* I LOVED attending the DECOVID data paper meeting.
  I'm so proud of that work!
  And really helpful to have EP there to give feedback - that was either very minor or positive and supportive!
  GREAT work from the team üíñ

### What did you achieve

* Comments to GT on her fellowship application.
* AIM community manager roles are now online!!
  Thank you to SA üôè

  * Community Manager, Open Collaboration: AIM RSF: https://cezanneondemand.intervieweb.it/turing/jobs/community_manager_open_collaboration_aim_rsf_19278
    * Deadline 6 Feb
* Kick off meeting with UKHSA.
* Linked up EDoN folks w CF.
* A couple of safe haven meeting discussions.
* Approved training application for AP.
* Facilitated a conversation in lab meeting about setting goals that got some good feedback.
* Sent reimbursements to MD.

  All a delight.
* Completed some HR paperwork for AM.
* Caught up with NG about a couple of topics - rambled a bit but hopefully was helpful!
* Got few meetings planned & in the calendar.

### What did you struggle with?

* I had intended to get GA comments on her paper and I just didn't manage it at all.
  NEXT WEEK üí™
* One project that I'm a co-i on is struggling a bit and I'm not sure of the best way forwards...
  Needs some reflection and probably some dedicated time investment.
  (Which is hard to find üòï)
* Didn't get my butt on linkedin to promote the jobs as I had intended... this could end up biting me if we don't get good folks for the RAM roles üò¨
  * I just really don't like linkedin!!

### What specific actions do you need to consider for maternity leave?

* Ooooph, I feel overwhelmed by this question.
  * Gotta just take this one step at a time... üí™
* I think cover for ASG / Turing leadership meetings is probably a high priority that I don't have a good answer for.
* Need to schedule meetings with CF, DB and CR quite urgently to get their perspectives on best ways forwards.
* Need to do my risk assessment... and maybe get some help from previously pregnant people to see what accommodations / support / equipment to ask for!

### Any other topics

Fun being back to work.
Particularly since the year is so freaking short for me üôÄ
