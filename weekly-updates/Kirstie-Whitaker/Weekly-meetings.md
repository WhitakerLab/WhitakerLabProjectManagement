## Date: 30 April 2021

*WOAH, I took a couple of Fridays off and really fell way way behind on a bunch of work.*
*As usual, I've been working my socks off... but not documenting what I've been doing.* 😭
*So this update is for FOUR WEEKS worth of activity - the month of April.* 🙀🙀🙀

### What brought you joy this month?

* I managed to send gifts for Turing Way folks who were attending CollabW21.
  * I'm distinctly horrible at actually posting cards and gifts so it brought me great joy (compared to my usual great guilt) to complete the send rather than just have the good idea.
  * MS helped me to no end by finding postal addresses, and my sister helped put all the chocolate eggs in little bags and motivate me to write the cards 💌
* Went for an IRL walk with labboos!!!
  * YAAAAAY 🐶 🐾 🌳🌳🌳
  * Particular gratitude to everyone who fed me for lunch because I'd forgotten to set aside enough time to pack some for myself 🥪
* EK transcribed my DSG Writing Training into a chapter for the Turing Way.
  * Joy, and a lot of deep gratitude too 🙏
* IKG & LC's Hamilton raps for the T-RECs process 🦖🦖🦖
* I'm so glad I could give some constructive feedback on an funding application even if it was super late in the day!
* Drove up to the Lake District for a week.
  So beautiful up here! 🌄
* MozFest call on a walk was lovely.
  Really validating to talk with CK about virtual events & their emotional toil.
* Some fun with GitHub Actions.... although not quite there yet!
* GORGEOUS 5 hour catch up with PV.
  I MISS collaborating with her ❣️
* Attended GK's thesis defense 🌟
* Enjoyed the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reOMyLafUVY 🦘🦘🦘
* Had a couple of chats with BM who is always just such a delight 💓
* AM is doing a fantastic job nudging me along without making me feel pressured.
  * Awesome prep for a couple of our big meetings at the end of the month 🌠
* Participated in the Tidelift livestream (not a podcast!) and wrote a big old twitter thread about so many thoughts!

### What did you struggle with?

* Onboarding documentation is very poor.
  Wildly out of date and doesn't point to the important pieces of information.
  Sad about that.
  * I think the lab slack channel and coffee chats are a good crutch... but I'm not in a good position there.
    Needs time and strategic focus.
    (Where on _earth_ will that come from?!)
* I had a couple of tough run ins during this month.
  Ways in which my behaviour hurt others in ways I didn't intent.
  * One I think I've fixed well.
    I apologised and I learned a valuable lesson.
  * The other I think the lesson is to not engage on that level.
    It isn't a helpful or constructive space for me to inhabit.
    * (I did apologise though!)
* Being told that I need to be more inspirational when the real problem is everyone's burned out :roll_eyes:
* There was Easter in this month, and I also took a Friday off to spend on the beach on the south coast.
  * To be honest, taking Fridays off is - I think - a tough idea.
    I really need them to stay caught up on work.
  * Goal for future Fridays off (got one coming) is to either work at least in part OR block a full day on Thurs or Mon to compensate.
* My expectations are high and I don't think I communicate them very well.
  * I need a better phrase for "too much rope to hang themselves" (it doesn't feel like a great mental image to propagate in 2021!!) because I think I need to warn people more that that's what I do and although there are benefits, and it is who I am, there are risks to look out for too.
* SUPER dropped the ball on a task that really could have caused harm to an individual.
  * Hopefully fixed now but I really feel bad about that ☹️
* The COVID19 situation in India is appalling and I'm terribly sad about that.
  * Seeing conferences planning for in person events is.... gauche to say the least.

### Any other topics

Had some medical stuff too, which took away a few chunks of time to get emails done 😬

Luna had some vet stuff too!
Hugely grateful to mum for taking her to the vet while I was in the lakes 🐾

## Date: 28 March 2021

* Feeling unheard and my time not being appropriately respected.
  * Thank yous to LA for picking me up after reliving a 2020 trauma.
* Knowing that we need governance in place to help move a project forwards but not having the _time_ to put that governance in place! 😩
* Honestly, just being WILDLY on the back foot ALL the time.
  It's exhausting.
  * I'm looking forward to Easter.

### Any other topics

Blocked 2 days the following week to try to catch up from this tangle.
Apart from all the email it does feel like I'm starting to bring my head up out of the water... a bit.

## Date: 14 March 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* CF really really helped me this week.
  Challenged me but then just _did_ a piece of work for me that would have taken so long if I'd stared at that blank page.

* AB & ME reviewed last weeks PR and left me lots of supportive comments 😻
  * https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/pull/435
* GA, IKG & SF gave a presentation about AutSPACEs at a philosophy conference!
  SO COOL!
  * http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4603091
* One of the team said "you did a great job" after a positive but challenging meeting which I really appreciated.
* Funding confirmed for the big grant.
  Waiting on the feedback to celebrate... but good news! 🎊
* Super fun lab meeting on https://www.consentfultech.io - love it!
* EXCELLENT job description design meeting with AM & MS
* SUCH a lovely conversation with BM.
  * Really supportive, and I think I was helpful too 🌻
* Listened (and did a good job not solutionising too much) when a friend was having a really rough day at work.
* Massively helpful conversation with CL - mentoring, planning, gossiping, solving.
  Donuts and a little bit of hail in Greenwich Park.
  * MUCH JOY 🍩 :deciduous_tree:
* Bought a copy of emergent strategy for a friend in need of rest and recuperation.

### What did you achieve

* TPS budget & request 💰
  * Fingers crossed 🤞
* Feedback on proposal for AS
* Welcomed 3 students to DECOVID! 🙌 🙏 🌟
  * Got a good email pinged off at the end of the week 👋
* Job description design meeting w MS & AM
* TPS / RAM 🐏 design meeting w AM
* Initiation planning meeting for big grant.
  * Helpful... ish.
    I didn't feel like we made much progress but I think we probably did in the long run.

  * Both were good, we have a beautiful little community here.
* Brainstormed _Turing Way_ training with MS
* GSOD planning call & slack chat
* EnvSensors monthly meeting 🌏

  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1786

### What did you struggle with?

* I struggled with International Women's Day having a corporate diversity lens 12 months into a global pandemic.
  * I did really enjoy the lab coffee chat and a 1:1 rant about _why_ HR acts the way they do though.
    That was both helpful and cathartic.
* I don't think I hit the right tone in one of the co-working sessions.
  I was stressed and I came out very strong.
  * The lesson here is that I should have prepped the faciliator in advance.
    I was waiting to see what the agenda was but I had some very specific (and I think genuinely urgent) tasks in mind.
  * I should have made that more explicit in advance rather than potentially surprising folks.
    * (Although to be fair to me, I'm not sure when I would have found the time for that.
    Maybe the answer is to find more folks to help with the workload.... hopefully that will be the case soon!)
* One of the ethics applications is tough.

### Any other topics

Onwards.
Moving at the speed of trust.

It does feel like we're going in the right direction though.

## Date: 7 March

*Updates covering 2 weeks as I had a few days off at the start of March.*

### What brought you joy this (2) weeks?

  It was a tough run because I also needed to fit my own oxygen mask.
  But I'm sad at how things turned out.
* EAG work was harder than it should have been.
* I'm disappointed with engagement across the Turing in general.
  I don't know what is up but there's something about 2021 that has just taken all the wind out of everyone's sails.
  * I really wish we could find time to support each other _more_ not less as we continue to be so isolated 😢
* The DSG workshop was super silent... I have absolutely no idea how it went 😩
  * Apparently the September reports were some of the best they've ever had though so maybe I made a good impression??
* Lab meeting discussion on arguments about barriers open science made me feel old & jaded.
  I think that's ok though.... I am old and jaded from an open science perspective 😅
* A few doc appts which took up some time and left me tired on one of the days.
  Had a whole day of watching Deep Space 9.... which was fine I think.
  It was what a needed 💤
* Found out a grant that I was Co-I on wasn't funded.
  Booooo

### Any other topics

Blurgh.
Feels like a lot of bits and not much substance.
But maybe I just have to be ok with chip chip chipping away.

The time off was excellent.
Strong recommendation 🌳🐾👩‍🍳😋💐

## Date: 21 February 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* My greatest joy this week was spending 3 hours working with AL on the community manager job descriptions.
  * Huge huge shout out to Brene Brown's values list and the exercise of picking just 2 or 3.
    It's such a hard task but SO valuable!
    * https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/workbook-art-pics-glossary/
    * For community managers I picked **stewardship**, **compassion** and **collaboration**.
    * For RAMs 🐏 AM and I picked **adaptability**, **legacy** and **perseverance**.
    * For my job I picked **vision**, **faith** and **justice**.
  * It surprised me how emotional I was when we started this exercise.
    It was so valuable to be able to articulate why I was so blocked - I felt incredibly lonely - and what I needed to move forwards - a safe space to be able to explore 🙏💕
* Coffee and (virutal) hangout with BM.
  What a delightful man.
  I miss getting to spend more time with him, and benefiting from his mentorship.
* I skipped doing the work I was supposed to catch up on Friday to attend the Engage at Turing student talks and they did SUCH a good job.
  I'm really glad I came along to ask questions and learn a little more.
  Definitely got a few folks to follow up with 💪
* Huge thank you to CH who gave me a call after the grant panel interview and said I did a good job.
  * Means so much 💜
* Brilliant catch up with IS, absolute joy as usual 🌺🌺🌺
* IKG was a fantastic support, as usual.
  * But particularly this week on a Friday during his holiday.
* Hangout with AllyM - I'm so glad we have this in the calendar now.
* Really glad SM was able to come to the Turing Way collaboration cafe!! ☕
* LOVE the help that IS was able to provide for ME! :heart_eyes:
  * https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/blob/master/weekly-updates/Maria-Eriksson/Mentoring-IS.md#date-11-february-2021
* Knowledge share this week made me a bit teary to actually see the work progressing, and hear how important it still is for clinicians.
* AB sent the TPS newsletter in its new format!
  * So beautiful!
  * http://elink.turing.ac.uk/m/1/59207972/p1-b21050-e368bf4a814a4324a28ac2cb84e12511/1/13/843f7bf5-d1bc-4395-b06f-13236425037e
* Maybe not exactly joy, but I helped a few friends through difficult frustrations with unsupportive colleagues (not at Turing) this week.
  * I'm glad I could be of some help.
  * Also, its mother lode dude.
    Not mother load.
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_lode

### What did you achieve

* Grant panel interview!!
  * It went ok... there are questions we can't answer well but we knew that going in.
  * There wasn't anything that really tripped us up.
  * 🤞😬🤞
* Attended [launch event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cores-launch-event-tickets-136365305299) for Stanford [Center for Open and REproducible Science](https://datascience.stanford.edu/cores) (CORES)
  * Loved Fernando's talk (as always):
* Had a fab conversation with KR at Berkeley BIDS (not to be confused with Brain BIDS 🧠😅)
  * Very very useful threads to pull on going forwards.
* SUPER useful conversation with VF on Monday.
  I feel like we're really iterating towards a strong plan.
* I dealt with a difficult EAG review with compassion.
  * I'm glad that I was able to say "I have time for this".
    It meant other work didn't get done, but I prioritised listening and caring for others.
* Really fun meeting with industry partner to scope potential future connections.
* Another partnerships meeting where I said some stuff but wasn't likely all that valuable 😬
* Governance chat with MS about Turing Way.
  * Followed by long visioning / scoping chat - more to come!
* Good progress on expectation setting for project.
  * Analytics steering group, knowledge share, leadership meeting all went well.
* Helpful future planning call w GA.
  * I think I'm iterating towards a vision for the citizen science project.
* 1:1s with IKG, EK, AB & ME.
* Super fun grant scoping call with JR!
* Career advice / chat call w DG - hopefully I was helpful!
  * And another version of that call including some interview prep with someone else 💻 🐁 🧠
* Fun lab meeting with demo on OpenMined duet from SB.
* Brainstorming meeting on EDI w AC.
* Progress on student project job description and TPS terms of reference but not quite there yet...
* Call w EM re: grant application, scheduled two meetings for next week to keep going!
* Website page up for Pangeo project!
  * https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/supporting-pangeo-community-driven-platform-big-data-geoscience
  * (needs a few edits, but cool nonetheless!)
* RIAC 😅
* ASG Theme Leads meeting.

### What did you struggle with?

* Good grief my hay fever 🌳🌳🌳 🤧🥺🤧🥺🤧🥺
  * I'll find a way to get the right levels of antihistamines in my body for the next 10 months, but....wow this was a frustrating weekend of itchy eyes and not being able to sleep properly ☹️
* Accidentally stood on a mini landmine.
  Was a good opportunity to calibrate my bluntness.
  That was definitely a "woah, I didn't realise I was going into a difficult territory" moment.
  * Lesson for next time: I think there are probably more sensitivities than I realise.
    And, like, we're 11 months into a global pandemic.
    It's ok to be softer than I think I need to be.
* Hilariously, after writing up all of what I did, I really really didn't get as much done as I should have done last week.
  * It does feel like the difficult conversations are starting to turn a corner to help with the resilience and scalability of my workload.
* I forgot to follow up with someone and I feel bad about that 😢
* I still have a bit of work to do on ways of working to make sure that one aspect of my work is going smoothly and effectively (super vague for anonymity.. but did want to capture because it was a struggle this week).
* I had some health stuff that was more of a battle to get coordinated than I'd have hoped.
  * It worked out ok in the end.
  * And the folks at my GP office were so lovely 💖

### Any other topics

Better than last week 🎢

## Date: 14 February 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* Working on a project coordinated over GitHub is SO FUN!
  * Thank you AB & SH! 🌃
* _The Turing Way_ recommended in "An Emerging Technology Charter for London" https://www.london.gov.uk/publications/emerging-technology-charter-london 🌟
* LC's lab meeting was incredible 😻
* Not exactly a joy, but CF helped me SO MUCH in getting my objectives written down this week.

### What did you achieve

* Objectivesaaaaaah!
  * Redacted version at [objectives-2020-2021.md](objectives-2020-2021.md).
* PhD candidate interviews for HDRUK Doctoral programme.
* Talk on _The Turing Way_ "at" the University of Florida.
  * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4537450
* All hands for project was tough but ultimately eye opening and hopefully useful.
* EnvSensors kick off meeting! 🌎🌍🌏
  * Got a GitHub repo 🌟
* Accenture Joint Steering Group meeting.
  * Actually did some prep work for this one - felt like I had more context to be able to participate!
* EAG discussion x2.
* Contract & planning discussions.
* Meeting on {reproducibility, reusability, openness} award.
* Chat w Raphtory team & industry contributors.
* 1:1 with IKG.
* First part of the AutSpaces meet up.

### What did you struggle with?

* I signed up to do some work that I really shouldn't have said yes to.
  The work doesn't benefit me in any way, I didn't enjoy it, and I didn't do a good job.
  Importantly it meant that I left behind far far too many other tasks.
  * Lesson for next time: **No is a complete sentence.**
* I find giving remote talks really uninspiring.
  The fact that I don't get to have interesting conversations with any of the ECRs really takes the shine off for me.
* Difficult conversations keep going.
  So far they're almost all in the direction that I reflected on over Christmas - needing to change my work practices from 2020 to give even a hope of some sustainability for 2021.
  But a couple are figuring out pathways back from deep hurt and pain.
  They're important but tough.
  * Lesson for next time: Maybe go a little more gentle on myself?
    I can't keep up full productivity and the emotional investment at the same time.
* I should have had a better attitude towards objectives.
  I _feel_ like we do them as we go along and that these are just bureaucracy, but they were a useful exercise.
  And one that shouldn't have been done at the last minute.
* I'm struggling to balance confidential discussions with a commitment to openness and transparency.
  I think that's going to take a bit of deep planning in the next few weeks.
* I fucked up and let someone down in a very non-graceful way.
  They were incredibly understanding though.
  * Lesson for next time: Say something earlier.

### Any other topics

Well, I think that proportion of joys to struggles fits my feelings about the week.

New week.
New start.
Here we go.

  KP did SO MUCH work on the response to reviewers and I am so grateful for her expertise :heart_eyes_cat:
* Meeting with Co-Is on the grant peer reviews was very affirming and lovely 😺
  * "This RSF proposal has a co-PI arrangement. This is good to see. Whilst Whittaker [sic] is relatively inexperienced as PI, they are a rising star. Holmes is vastly experienced and I would expect them to provide excellent mentoring." 🌠🌠🌠
  * "The PI seems well placed to lead the RSF. They are very experienced in areas of data management and analysis." 😊😊😊
* Brilliant quote shared by LC:
  * https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/145753-the-merest-accident-of-microgeography-had-meant-that-the-first
  * > "The merest accident of microgeography had meant that the first man to hear the voice of Om, and who gave Om his view of humans, was a shepherd and not a goatherd.
    > They have quite different ways of looking at the world, and the whole of history might have been different.
    > For sheep are stupid, and have to be driven.
    > But goats are intelligent, and need to be led."

### What did you struggle with?

* Difficult conversations continue.
  Worth it.
  I hope.
  * Just have to assume that betting on myself, my time, my value alignment is better than "conventional wisdom" 😩 🤞 💪
* Ranting too much.
  I don't like sounding negative all the time.
  * Not nice when either to senior or more junior folks.
    I probably need more rest / down time.
* Kinda sorta said no to someone.... not in the most concrete way.
  Could have been better.

### Any other topics

I had a bunch of doc / life stuff this week, and I think I dealt with work tasks.... ok around them.
Workouts kinda dropped, but I made some good progress on my cross stitch.
Watched all of FATE (The Winx Saga) over the weekend.
Can't be that bad 🧚‍♀️

## Date: 31 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

### What did you struggle with?

* idk, it isn't clear that I got anything done last week.
  I wish I could just think of it as being away for those 4 days - which is the correct framing... but not a headspace I can get myself into.
* Made a bit of progress on computer says no, but also not feeling supported on the work I need to get done.
* These job descriptions are really hanging over me.
  * Lets set a goal to get these out from my head by the end of next week.
    They will bring me joy... if I can find a breakthrough on them.

## Date: 22 January 2021

### What did you struggle with?

* Feeling like I get freaking conflicting instructions - how can people be more involved, oh but they can't actually _be involved_. 😠🤬
* Can't find speakers for a knowledge share.
  No one wants to share their knowledge :sob:
* DOODLES AAAAAAH.
  They seem like such a good idea.
  But actually, I hate them

* Still haven't got my calendar properly sorted out for the year.
  Missing a bunch of 1:1s... ☹️

  * I tried.
    I'm not going to take part in that conversation again.

### Any other topics

Not much more to add.
Next week is going to be wild :scream_cat:

## Date: 15 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* SUBMITTED THE GRANT! 🥂
  YEAAAAAAAH! 🎊🎊🎊
  * I don't think its perfect but I do think its pretty good.
  * I particularly want to acknowledge how much effort has gone into equity and inclusion and the representation of ECRs at decision making levels.
    I am SO HOPEFUL that this works out. 🤞😬🤞
  * I'm also proud of the email that I sent to say thank you to all the folks who made it happen.
    I often _mean_ to send those messages but I don't actually get them done.
* I made some good progress on working with the lab on how we can adapt the interactions to grow with my responsibilities.
  Some of those conversations weren't the easiest but I'm proud of myself for having them.
  * Lab meeting was good I think.
    I loved the answers around the definition of service.
  * I don't think I got across my needs as well as I had hoped I did.
    But at least the follow up conversations helped me to see that I hadn't and could clarify.
* Great long conversation with AM and SB.
  Linked because I walked the gated road with them both but on different days.
  Always a delight 🌻
* The TPS newsletter is SO COOL!
* HM led a project check in all by himself and I'm super proud & psyched 👾
* Not really joy but I did say thank you to someone who has been doing really tough work on behalf of the TPS programme.
  I'm glad I made the effort to say that.
* Fast streamer accepted!! WOOOOO!! :star2: :star2: :star2:
* Introducing EK to the project team 😻
* Being asked to write a letter endorsing the importance of open source work is PRETTY COOL.
  * Same for the recommendation letter!! 💖

### What did you achieve

* Submitted the grant.
  Made me joyful.
  See above 😜
* Planning for lab interactions / mentorship
  * And in particular some pretty nice networkx code to showcase selected interactions 😆
* Onboarded EK (well... mostly) and I am SO GRATEFUL for her being here! 🙏
* Fun ethics planning - event series and link up with someone looking for advice.
* Planning for RAM 🐏 positions.
  Really useful conversations.
* Training Steering Group meeting.
  * Not sure how much I _achieved_ but I did support & endorse really great work done by others 😅
* Grant feedback & planning call(s).
* I _HOPE_ I helped make a plan for coordinating with the Carpentries.
* Had to enforce a code of conduct violation.
  That was wild.
  But I think I did a good job 💜
* Prepped for TPS Showcase next week.
* WILDLY not my achievement but ARIELLE got the videos submitted for the ASG MTR and they are FAB!
* BIDS Steering Group meeting.
  * FREAKING SENT the authorship guidelines .... FINALLY 💪
* Checked in with one of the TPS projects.
  Pretty confident I was reassuring.
  Hopefully I also sparked a few ideas! :grin:
* Gave useful feedback on a postdoc application! 🤔
* Said hi to the Engage at Turing students a few times.
  Hopefully in a useful way!
* Prep meeting for ASG MTR.
* Submitted the letter of recommendation for Pangeo work.
* Endorsed GSOC applications for Autistica & Turing Way projects 🙌
  * They were really done by others!
  * Gave a bit of feedback on OLS project ideas too.
* Prepped giving a reference for someone.
  Wildly excited!

### What did you struggle with?

* I had a couple of tough conversations that I think are going to lead to me having to make some difficult decisions.
  I really hope that they landed ok and that it was for the good of all...
  * (One motivational, one to say no)
* I felt patronised a couple of times this week.
  I'm curious to reflect on whether that's _me_ perceiving something that isn't there... or whether its real.
  Going to try to have one follow up conversation to check in.
* I really really hope that I was motivating in one of my conversations and not just rambling and - potentially - being patronising back 😬
  * Note to self, need to check in with that person to find out.
* I LOVED my no-meeting Friday but I didn't reply to my emails / tasks, nor get this update done.
  * So I need to do a tiny bit more to stay on top of those.
  * Although, having said that, I did submit a pretty huge grant this week 😆
    Maybe I can be a bit more gentle with myself.
* HAHA - I can't believe I almost forgot this.
  **I will never be the person in charge of making a gantt chart ever again.**
  * That shit was not. my. jam. 🍯

### Any other topics

It's amazing how much I do when I actually write it all down 🙀

Had a chill weekend, two lovely walks.
Loads of cross stitchin.

## Date: 8 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* I had a phone conversation with JH about Phoenix plans that I got really jazzed about.
  But more importantly it was just lovely to get a bit of mentorship & allyship from a friend.
* Movement forwards with connecting Raphtory with an industry team who are using their code!!
* Really exciting meetings with co-is and collaborators on the big grant (deadline 12 Jan).
  I'm feeling very inspired! :sparkling_heart:
* Not joy exactly but a feeling of purpose - I had a conversation with someone going through a tough time, listened and gave advice.
  Most importantly, I said "I believe you" which I think meant more than anything else I could have said or done.
* Lab meeting was a beautiful moment of holding space for each other around the news of the attempted coup in the USA and sharing some of our personal challenges and needs for 2021.
  In particular I was proud that I shared what my needs were and how the members of the lab can help me.
* The snow on Friday was just glorious.
  So incredibly beautiful.
* I loved drawing a network with networkx!!
  I still got it!
  * Even made some [accidental art](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1347139895161196556?s=20)
* No meeting Friday was the freaking BOMB!
* Co-working on [Year Compass](https://yearcompass.com/#download) with the CS&S team was wonderful.

### What did you achieve?

* Knowledge share seminar and strategic planning with HM and CH.
  * Set a few plans in motion for Project :fire::bird:
* Recruitment process for community manager support.
* Clarity on what we're trying to do for the big grant.
  Both internally and externally it seems like we're in a really powerful position.
  * Not always easy, but the work I did in the run up was very well aligned.
* Really fun brainstorming on TPS leadership plans.
* Useful (I hope!) feedback on EAG application.
* Worked out every day.

### What did you struggle with?

* I haven't set my calendar up the way I had hoped I would.
  I still need to get a LOT of 1:1 meetings in there.
* I didn't get job descriptions written.
  * I think I'm super blocked on those.
    I should probably chat with AL & get some input.

### Any other topics

Ah, I really hope I can keep this up :crossed_fingers:
