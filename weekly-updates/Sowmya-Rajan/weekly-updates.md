I have helped LC the most this week exchanging ideas over the on-boarding process.
  LC - onboarding process is going well!! We can talk about progress report and fortnightly reporting for those parts of it!

LC helped me a lot to settle in and made me understand. 

#### What did you achieve?

* I followed Django tutorials and wrote a few python and HTML scripts. 
* I created various model apps with templates for the view, creation of forms, navbar etc. I created these forms thinking they were important. I understand this might look very basic but I feel this can be applied on the already exiting platform as well.

* Dynamic Linking of URLs.
