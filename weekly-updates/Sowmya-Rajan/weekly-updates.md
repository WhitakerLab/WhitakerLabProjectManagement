## Date 4th May


#### Who did you help this week?

I have helped LC the most this week exchanging ideas over the on-boarding process.
  LC - onboarding process is going well!! We can talk about progress report and fortnightly reporting for those parts of it!

#### Who helped you this week?

LC helped me a lot to settle in and made me understand. 

#### What did you achieve?

* I followed Django tutorials and wrote a few python and HTML scripts. 
* I created various model apps with templates for the view, creation of forms, navbar etc. I created these forms thinking they were important. I understand this might look very basic but I feel this can be applied on the already exiting platform as well.
* This was all done on the local host.
* Dynamic Linking of URLs.

  LC This is all fab ✨
  
#### What did you struggle with?

* I struggled with concepts of Django and HTML which I don't have experience of. I am following tutorials by the side and implementing on the side.
* I am also struggling on time management.

  LC we can discuss ways of time management in our next meeting! There are lots of ways out there to help with that, such as blocking time, it's just finding what works for you!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I would like to test the code that I worked last week on the existing platform. I think it would take a day to try this out. 
* Once I do this, I will follow other issues or to-do's that are lined up and implement it. 

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I would like a feedback to know whether I am heading towards the right direction.
* Any areas that I need to improve.

#### Any other topics

* I am also interested in the research on ASD and hence I read up as many articles as possible in my free time. 
* I wanted to improve myself in areas of Data Analysis as well. So trying to take up few kaggle projects. 
 LC sounds like a good plan 👍
