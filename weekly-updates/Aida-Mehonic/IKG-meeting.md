### Date: 30 June 2021

### Past: What would you highlight from the past couple of weeks? Did you face any new challenges? You can take this opportunity to reflect on what we discussed in our previous session.
* We have the RAM interviews tomorrow! Doing some final prep today.
* We drafted a pitch for an article in Nature Comments. Not sure if we should proceed though, or wait to polish it a bit: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11IQ-zWxutSHKlZhEhonoFyO2tlTVOUqiw0FBX4egrKE/edit
* I am trying to get appropriate IT permissions for the RAM team --- need to have admin rights to install Python etc. 


### Present: How are you feeling? Where do you see yourself right now?
* It's very hot weather outside, so struggling to keep the usual pace actually. But I feel productive after 8pm, so I do a bit of work then.
* I am so looking forward to coding a bit, after I sort out my Python installation etc.

### Future: What will the focus for this meeting be? Hopefully the two previous questions prompt an idea  for this question. If not, we will figure it out together!
* Let's see!

### Past: What would you highlight from the past couple of weeks? Did you face any new challenges? You can take this opportunity to reflect on what we discussed in our previous session.
* DWP Data Trust discussion - let me update you in the meeting!
* Also, I reeeeally want to write a couple of papers over the summer. Fingers crossed that the writing muses visit me sometimes.
  * IKG: Hooray, writing! The people I mentioned writing on agent-based models are [Kevin Zollman](http://www.kevinzollman.com/papers.html) (I had [this paper](http://www.kevinzollman.com/uploads/5/0/3/6/50361245/crediteconomy-2017-6-14.pdf) modelling the credit economy in mind) and [Cailin O'Connor](http://cailinoconnor.com/) (who modelled the effect of [retractions](http://cailinoconnor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Retractions_in_Epistemic_Networks-2.pdf)).
### Present: How are you feeling? Where do you see yourself right now?
* I am just back from hols. :tada:
* Happy to slowly start the 'summer phase' at work - focussing more on writing, coding and analysis.
  * IKG: Ah, ths summer phase! When the bees buzz, the sun shines and the electronic devices can't handle the heat!
### Future: What will the focus for this meeting be? Hopefully the two previous questions prompt an idea  for this question. If not, we will figure it out together!
* I know we spoke about writing before... but I would still love to chat about your writing process.
  * IKG: My process is particular to my studying philosophy and roughly goes:
    1. Find inspiration from the small things, maybe a coffee, a flower, or the sociopolitical underpinnings of the ideologies you encounter as they relate with capitalistic superstructures;
    2. Find an opinion worth fighting for (e.g.: coffee is a terrible product that enslaves farmers and responds to thye whims of commodity traders)
    3. Outline an argument for that opinion
    4. Critique your outline, realise it is bad and revisit your initial opinion.
    5. Repeat 2 to 4 until you create a strong argument for a rather boring opinion (e.g.: coffee tastes better than just plain coffee beans)
    6. Literature review! What arguments have been made pertaining to your view? Are there people pro and against? What sources can support your argument and how will you refute contrary views?
    7. Use 6 to revisit 2 to 5.
    8. WRITE.
  * Alternatively, [just](https://ismaelkg.medium.com/do-we-need-research-ethics-committees-dc83bb9eabf) write [super short](https://ismaelkg.medium.com/epistemic-humility-vs-epistemic-humility-740871e251db) stuff without thinking too much!

* DWP Data Trust discussion - let's talk in the meeting!
  * IKG: Thanks for bringing this up! What exciting opportunities!

### Present: How are you feeling? Where do you see yourself right now?
* I am writing the RAM paper - requires quite a bit of research of the landscape and careful argument-building. 
* Book Dash this week
* Also, OLS graduation next week. 
  * IKG: Goodness, so many things at a go! Keep it up! But also take some holidays soon, hehe

### Future: What will the focus for this meeting be? Hopefully the two previous questions prompt an idea  for this question. If not, we will figure it out together!
* Let's talk about the DWP discussion

### Date: 21 April 2021

### Past: What would you highlight from the past couple of weeks? Did you face any new challenges? You can take this opportunity to reflect on what we discussed in our previous session.
* It would be good if I found a way to dig a little deeper into a topic (lit review, landscape analysis) - division of scholarly work versus facilitating work
  * IKG: I am not sure what this means but let's discuss!

### Present: How are you feeling? Where do you see yourself right now?
* I need to think through a process for scoping open source toolkits 
* a Kaggle competition might be a good idea for some 
  * IKG: Would be a great chat for the lab and The Turing Way Community!

### Future: What will the focus for this meeting be? Hopefully the two previous questions prompt an idea  for this question. If not, we will figure it out together!
* Let's talk about writing. How does your process work? What are some good habits?
* I have started writing a position paper on "Why are RAMs useful"
* I will also soon be writing a couple of Turing Way chapters 
  * IKG: I first think of the position I want to take (pro- or anti-X), then I build an argument for that position (Y is bad, X is similar to Y, therefore X is bad), and then I break each of these points us (introduce Y, maybe with a literature review; explain why Y is bad; introuce X, relate to Y; conclude that Y is bad with some nuance), and *then* I don't visit the argument outline for a few weeks, after which I write 17 versions of it and, finally, give up entirely =)

* Nice template - well done!!
* My highlights: 
  * I went to CW21 which was really valuable for me as a newbie to this community. It was an unconference which was fun and different. Will talk about it more during Lab meeting tomorrow.
  * We are onboarding newly arrived postdocs on ASG. It's been challenging to mainly communicate and be clear on the division of resposbilities with other people involved in onboarding --- but I think we have a good plan, and will do much better next time.
  * I got to attend Programme and Project meetings for AI for Science and I am so excited about working with them - lovely projects and lovely people.
    * IKG: This is all very awesome! I look forward to hearing about how the new meetings unfold!

### Present: How are you feeling? Where do you see yourself right now?
* Feeling: rested, and also a lot less 'wired' than usual. I guess it shows that I took several days to read a novel and just hang out without trying to achieve anything in particular. I guess it's good for my nervous system to occasionally shut down.
* Excited about ramping up the RAM work with project teams.
  * IKG: I feel you! Four ays are now apparently too many to take off in a row!

### Future: What will the focus for this meeting be? Hopefully the two previous questions prompt an idea  for this question. If not, we will figure it out together!
* Let's figure this one out together!
  * IKG: We figured out we had to talk about:
      (i) leading Turing Way sessions, which will totally be doable in some time! And
      (ii) liaising with very different teams but making sure not to become overworked!
