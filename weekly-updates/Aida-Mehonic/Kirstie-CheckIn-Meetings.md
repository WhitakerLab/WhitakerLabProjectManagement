### Date: 10 January 2022

#### Who did you help over the past fortnight? 
* Mostly JD and AC getting on with their work.
  * KW: Brilliant! ‚òÄÔ∏è

#### Who helped you over the past fortnight?
* I think folks in the DSG worked really hard! My co-facilitator was excellent (he is a PhD student). 

#### What did you achieve?
* Managed to juggle a huge number of meetings into year-end. üòÇ
  * KW: Amen! I hope you get a breath in January!

#### What did you struggle with?
* DSG was exhausting, especially as I tried not to entirely drop the ball on my day job (I presented at ASG MB, Partnerships monthly, joined an Exeter EI EAB, etc). 

#### What would you like to work on next fortnight?
* My goal is to get the RAM position paper to a decent draft by the end of Jan.
* RA showcase planning and figuring out who to invite with NG's team.
  * KW: I'll introduce you to SC this week - I'm hopeful he can be a really strong connection for us!
* I'll submit my L&D on Cezanne this week (finally!)
  * KW: Aaaaaaactually - the objectives need updating for your new role (TPS Senior Researcher) so if you can have a read though those and ping them back to me for a review that would be super helpful üôè
* Get on with the RAM project work as well: follow up on CEFAS & scivision, manage RADDISH, scope DyME. 
* Recruitment!!
  * KW: Discussed in meeting - likely reopen until 30 January.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?
* Showcase is a massive thing - any steer on who to invite for which project, how to curate and manage the event would be very welcome, and anything else would be very welcome.
  * KW: Good chat in the meeting - try actioning the fast streamers who are working in the Office for the Director! I think they'll come into contact with lots of good people / organisations and we just need them to remember to tell us (you!)
  * Also, get the prep meetings with projects that are going to pitch in the calendar ASAP - probably for end of Feb but hopefully with enough time for them to realise that they have more work to do to prepare üò¨
* For the RAM paper: If you have any papers (or initiatives) that you think I should obviously reference, ping me! :)
  * KW: I will keep my eyes open - and then I think the other thing to consider is who the audience is... JC, MG are worth pitching to I think!

### Date: 17 November 2021

#### Who did you help over the past fortnight? 
* The RAM team - as we're learning the ropes of the job together. üí™ 
  * KW: I'm so enjoying the vibe!! Well done!

#### Who helped you over the past fortnight?
* Also, the RAM team - they always have loads of ideas and so I get feedback on my thinking. 
  * KW: As it should be!! ‚ú®
* JM - with DSG plans. 

#### What did you achieve?
* Onboarding AC and JD into ASG projects has been the most successful and the most exciting thing. I think the team dynamics is really fun and the fact that we have complementary skills works really well so far. 
* We came up with some team processes - weekly meetings, 1-2-1s, github repo process - the project board and the Issues, etc. For example, we had an indepth exploration of whether to use Github Projects (Beta). 
* AC and JD scoped and started working on their side projects - I supported them in this. 
* RADDISH - I attended their project meeting and we brainstormed about stakeholders - we came up with three potential stakeholders to focus on in the period to March: UKAEA, Met Office and the Underground Farm. One networking meeting mid-December (with the Met Office) and one stakeholder workshop to organise end of Jan / beginning of Feb.
  * KW: This plan sounds GREAT.

#### What did you struggle with?
* Una's nursery adjustment has been a big theme in my life over the past fortnight - happy to say that we have a very good rhythm now. üéâ üë∂
* Now that I have more cleanly protected time for work, I want to also ramp up my own project work, in addition to supporting JD and AC. This didn't recieve as much attention as I would have wanted.

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* EVERYTHING :)))
* On a serious note: continue supporting AC and JD as they embed into ASG projects; on my own projects, follow up with: RADDISH, IceNET, DyME, scivision. Chat with AD & AC on the Health Theme Impact. Follow up with JM about equadratures and the upcoming DSGs. 

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?
* Facilitating the December DSG - any advice on managing the technical hands on work and the facilitation?
  * KW: Good chat in the meeting - will be quite RAM-y to be faciliating! (Just a bit more work üò¨)
* Broad question: when RAMs work on inviting organisations to test a new research application - okay to aim for the 'social good' orgs as a default? 
  * KW: What an interesting question!! We discussed in the meeting 3 different dimensions: 1) social good / public sector, or 2) strengthen internal / existing Turing partnerships, or 3) "get shit done" (who do we know already who are interested!)
  * I think all 3 are totally justifiable so long as you don't end up with an overly homogenous grouping at the end.
  * Really great question and glad you're thinking about this üï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏è

### Date: 21 October 2021

#### Who did you help over the past fortnight? 
* AC - onboarding 
  * KW: Great - two üêès!!

#### Who helped you over the past fortnight?

#### What did you achieve?
* I've been off work a lot over the past month (mostly annual leave and some sickness days).
* Presented at ASG Mgmt Board Meeting. 
* Presented at Whitaker Lab meeting on impact & stakeholder mapping for ASG.
* Facilitated the Shocks and Resilience Journal Club session.
* Attended the stakeholder workshop for the 'Food Security' within E&S and volunteered to join the Community & Infrastructure working group. 
* Joined a team meeting for the RADDISH project. Agreed to work with SG to organise a stakeholder workshop in November. 
  * KW: Great! Exciting üöÄ
* Took part in the Leadership Panel for TPS. 
* Attended a SPARRA seminar - RAM plans to be created in discussion with AC. 
* Wrote my Objectives and we signed them off together. 
* I pitched the plan to create a Roadmap for Scivision to the team and then launch it during our first community call. They liked it. I'm following up to fix the date.
  * KW: Make sure to connect with MS, EK and AB about running the community calls - there are real skills around making them both useful and having space for people to share their perspectives
* Met new joiner AD.
  * KW: Great!
* Had a chat with HS and McC about potentially getting some Band 2 support for the RAM team (coordinator?) as an agency temp for 6 months. 
* I have been assigned a Turing mentor and a Turing mentee for the next 3 months.
* I finally finished the JD for the DSH RAM.
  * KW: AND I REVIEWED IT WHAAAAAAT?!

#### What did you struggle with?
* LOL, this has been a hard month, but not because of work. Una needs to adjust to her nursery properly, and then all will be well. Getting there. 
  * KW: üåªüåªüåª

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* Help AC with settling in and specifically around ideas for SPARRA. 
* Liase with SG to scope the remit of the stakeholder/user workshop for RADDISH and to begin organising. 
* Get in applications to the December DSG for the RAM team. 
  * KW: Yes please. It will feel like a lot of time but it will be really worth it I think üå∫
* Liaise with REG to get a place for AC to attend their Data Science as a Craft training course. 
  * KW: GREAT.
* Follow up with DyME about RAM support (just awarded extra funding). 
* Follow up with TA about IceNet RAM plans. 
* Have a chat during TPS coffee about the community building strategy for Raphtory. 
* Prepare the RAM quarterly report. 

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?
* What do you think about getting a 6 month temp placement in the RAM team (funded by ASG)? I think this would be helpful if we go ahead and organise the RAM (un)conference in March 2022 that we discussed last week. This idea was suggested by HS and AC. 
  * KW: Chatted about in the meeting - I'm not sure that a coordinator will be helpful for the RAM event but maybe they could be helpful for some user testing?


### Date: 15 September 2021

#### Who did you help over the past fortnight? 
* SG - mentoring chat - we're now planning thematic chats - https://hackmd.io/@sgibson91/mentor-meeting-planning
  * KW: Very cool - can you share this in the lab slack channel - I think others would likely find it very helpful too!
  * (I have been thinking about needing to check back in with folks for mentoring, especially with new starters!)

#### Who helped you this week?
* HMc - lots of regular check-ins
  * KW: Great

#### What did you achieve?
* Main thing: Completed the (first version of the) impact narrative & stakeholder mapping project and presented the results to ASG Central - received good feedback!
  * KW: Well done!!
  * Can you find a slot for a lab meeting? That would be great to share and discuss!
* Populated the RAM repo with 29 research applications from across ASG (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ASG_RAM/projects). I also provisionally assigned some of them as red (very likely to have socio-economic benefit within 18 months), orange (likely) and yellow (needs more time for soc-econ benefit) - ASG Central liked this approach and are expecting to see 10-15 projects in the red & orange category. They also suggested that each RAM works on 4-5 of these red/orange projects and drives their impact over the next 18 months.
  * KW: üî• for hot! üòÇ 
  * Good discussion about making sure RAMs don't end up in silos - co-working, bringing questions for the other üêèüêè and having rotating spotlights for whiteboarding conversations üëç
* I was invited to present a short version of my stakeholder mapping + RAM project prioritisation board at ASG Mgmt meeting next week.
  * KW: Looking forward to it!
* I had a meeting with PE from the Met Office - learned a lot. 
* MS and I presented our deck on CM and RAM roles at two internal Turing team meetings - one for the PMU and one for the RPMs. 
  * KW: GREAT - really glad you're shopping this presentation around!
* I caught up with JL from Comms on Impact Stories related to ASG. We've agreed to keep each other up to date as we find out more. 
  * KW: That sounds really good - and very related to AR's role when he starts!
* I met with HS from ASG Central. I started handing over the ASG impact project to her. 
  * KW: She seems really good - I'm glad you're able to hand over some of this work to her ‚úîÔ∏è
* I attended the LMDT meeting with govt stakeholders.
  * KW: Great! Glad you went - thank you!
* Drafted job description for DSG RAM üíªüêè

#### What did you struggle with?
* Getting actionable insights from the stakeholder map itself is not obvious.
  * KW: Accountability for the win!

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* Present at the ASG Mngmt meeting next week 
* Facilitate the S&R Journal Club session this afternoon
  * KW: Thank you for coordinating this - I hope it goes really well!
* Progress the red/orange/yellow mapping for RAM projects through conversations with researchers - get more meetings in the diary!
  * KW: And maybe start to think about meetings with AC too? Start date coming up soon!
    * (Oh, maybe not as soon - keep rocking!)
* Attend the stakeholder workshop for E&S CTP sub-project
  * KW: Super interesting - update that stakeholder map üòâ
* Organise the first external contributor event for scivision - let's chat about this?
* Reviewer duties for the TPS Leadership Call 
  * KW: Exciiiiting!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?
* Let's chat about the scivision contributor event 
* Also, let's chat about the red/orange/yellow categories for RAM projects 
* Calendar clash sorrows: whitaker lab meeting and the weekly scivision meeting are now both 4pm on Thu - should I try and ask scivision folks to reschedule theirs? Feels a bit heavy-handed...
  * KW: Would you mind, just in case there's a way for them to schoosh by an hour? (Feel free to cc me and say sorry!)


### Date: 11 August 2021

#### Who did you help over the past fortnight? 
* SG & GA - mentoring chat
  * KW: Thank you üíñ 

#### Who helped you this week?
* JB - with MondoDB
  * KW: YAY! üöÄüåü
  * Capture instructions in GitHub repository (your fork of the das-public one?)?
* HMc - with stakeholder mapping 

#### What did you achieve?
* Completed meetings with EDT CTP and with E&S CTP for the stakeholder mapping project; promoted this project at the ASG Ops meeting to get RPMs input
  Will send round a "survey" to all the RPMs asking them to nominate any research outputs from their areas that could be promoted to users. 
* Made some progress in conversations around ASG & DSGs... spoke to JM.
  Some sort of plan is shaping up.
  CEFAS will go ahead in Dec 2021 and an ASG focussed DSG is proposed for Sep 2022.
  `scivision` should be used in both.
  * KW: Very fun!!
  * KW: Consider having all 3 RAMs participate in the December DSG - team building for you three (but work across different projects) and good immersion for seeing what users do / what they need ‚ú®
* Two RAMs all lined up to start working in the autumn - so excited!
  * KW: YAAAAAAAAAY!! WELL DONE! üêèüêèüêè
* Facilitated a session on negotiating at Whitaker Lab meeting last week.
* Learned the basics of MongoDB - including how to use Compass and how to run some simple command line queries and how a simple database is organised. 
* Started contributing to the scivision repo - 1) advice on licensing and 2) contribution guidelines for now.
  * KW: Fab! Please capture your contributions and whether they relate to The Turing Way somewhere - maybe _in_ The Turing Way?
    * Here's the page: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#a
    * Remember that ensuring that The Turing Way is _used_ IS a contribution! üôå
* Had some RAM conversations with ASG Central, including setting up regular catch-ups with HM and AC going forward. 
* Created a Github project board for ASG RAM projects in preparation for onboarding JD and AC.
* Turing IT agreed to grant REG-style permissions to the RAM team & MACs as a default (unless someone specifically requests a PC).
  * KW: GREAT - well done!

#### What did you struggle with?
* Lots of PIs on ASG have joined mid-way through ASG.
  Sometimes, there are gaps in articulating the impact narrative of ASG as a result.

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* Produce ASG Stakeholder Map 1.0 
* Have a meeting with the CEO of the Met Office
  * KW: Exciting!
* Make more progress with pre-processing large datasets in MongoDB & think about whether the new UKRI OA policy can be somehow referenced in DAS 2.0

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?
* Let's chat about the impact narrative & stakeholder map for TPS.
  * Or better to schedule a separate hour for this with AB as well?
  * KW: Yes - please lets schedule a separate session for this - there are just a few too many things going on at the moment in my poor head!
* Let's chat about the impact narrative for ASG in general.
* Let's chat about DSGs and ASG outputs.
* Let's chat about plans for RAMs in general (including DSGs, PP and other avenues).

  * KW: Fantastic - well done!! 
* Had an indepth conversation with JR about DSH strategy - felt like I am getting to grips with this important aspect of TPS work
  * KW: FAB - thank you üí™ 
* Prepared (almost there!) for OLS graduation tomorrow.
  * KW: üéì
* Took part in some of the Book Dash sessions last week and got my first merge into The Turing Way and started my first chapter :sparkles:
  * KW: WOOOOO üìöüí®
* Continued on setting up the Impact Reading Group --- we're about to ask for funding for the first speaker.
 
#### What did you struggle with?

* I've been generally tired recently.
  I struggle with maintaining my usual pace and I feel less produtive.
  I am taking some annual leave at the end of this week - I think I need it and that I'll come back refreshed and able to pick up the normal pace again.
  * KW: I'm glad you have that annual leave. All your RAM work is long haul changes so take care of yourself first in order to change the world üêè üåç

#### What did you achieve?

* Put together a job description for an ASG Community Manager
  * KW: GREAT. Thank you üå†
* Drafted the first skeleton of 'Mind the skills gap in academia: can a RAM be an effective solution?' paper (provocative title); agreed with Malvika that the paper is my official OLS training output for the graduation (in 3 weeks)
  * KW: Ooooooh - what fun!
  * Discussion in the meeting about "what problem are RAMs trying to solve?" 
    * I think my perspective is that RAMs are huge contributions to _team science_ and _collaborative working_... I guess you're fixing a "soft skills" ü§Æ gap...
    * Digital skills around bridging jargon for sure - skills that people need to collaborate.
    * I guess I see RAMs üêèüêèüêè more around solving the _incentives_ rather than the _skills_ gaps.
    * Do we need academia to move towards _products_? Should that be something that industry is responsible for?
* Coordinated a scoping session for the computer vision toolkit for DS4S üéâ
  * KW: GREAT WORK HERE! We achieved the goal :star2:
* Had first discussions towards scoping an engagement with an organisation around a 'data trust' - slow, but very ambitious potentially
  * KW: Keep an eye on that project - v interesting üëÄ
* Coordinated the Intro to GitHub session for ASG postdocs
  * KW: Well done!
* DAS paper: downloaded the most recent data; installed MongoDB; went through some of the existing data pipeline scripts to try and understand the flow; arranged a slot with IS to discuss
  * KW: Delighted!
* Followed the Pangeo discussion: should there be a RAM to coordinate with the user community?
  * KW: Yes.... but I think we also have some ASG RAM resource to potentially help?
* Went to a fun TPS seminar (CZI), listened to Data as an Instrument of Coloniality, read some stuff around Research Impact, started reading The Emergent Strategy, re-read parts of a book I originally read 5 years ago (Reinventing Organisations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage in Human Consciousness) ‚ú®
  * KW: SO GREAT.

#### What did you struggle with?

* DAS: going through other people's scripts can be challenging 
  * KW: OMG LOOOOOLLLLLZZZZZ - so true!
 
#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I should present at the ASG MB board meeting next week - prep for that 
* I would like to complete a first properly readable draft of the "RAM position paper" ‚ú®
* Prep for the OLS graduation
* Progress the discussion about the data trust org
* * Make some progress with DAS after discussing with IS

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

  * KW: Covered in meeting! Well done keeping us on topic üòÄ

### Date: 21 April 2021

#### Who did you help over the past fortnight?

* RD - new joiner in the AI Programmme/PMU 
* HD - on Turing impact and strategy
* HM - onboarding postdocs in general
* SG - mentoring chat

#### Who helped you this week?

* IGK - mentoring chat
* KW - facilitating sessions on HackMD

#### What did you achieve?

* We onboarded ASG postdocs üéâ
* We have made a plan for the Impact Reading/Working Group ‚ú®
* We made provisional stakeholder engagement plans for DS4S work
* I started suggesting 'product management-y' advice to the computer vision toolkit work in DS4S, for example what the scoping process might look like
  * KW: Yeaaaaaah!! This is why you're here from the _start_ of projects not just at the end!
* We sent the RAM JD to Recruitment üéâ
  * KW: And got some comments back ‚úîÔ∏è

#### What did you struggle with?

* I think for me, the next stage of "success" will be to:
  * Demonstrate very hands-on technical interventions: for example, whether to integrate a toolkit within existing open source projects
    * KW: Raphtory, sktime, data safe haven are all good examples of RAM work... but you're also doing a lot of work at the moment, from my perspective there's no great rush to demonstrate this success just yet!
  * Build up to producing more scholarly output: I think I am still in the service+strategy mindset, and I am slowly expanding my ability to produce scholarly works (position papers, Turing Way chapters, lit reviews, research papers, etc)
  * KW: Don't forget Zombie Marie Curie's advice: https://xkcd.com/896
  * What about uplevelling the Data Availability Statement work to a 10/10 according to the Turing Way?
  *  https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public
 
#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I have a meeting with AD tomorrow to discuss RAM work for DCE 
  * KW: I think this will be a super fun meeting! Enjoy! :stars: 
* I have a meeting with DWP about DSH
  * KW: FAB - I'll come along to the meeting, but you and JR take the lead! Make sure to check in with NG beforehand too please üå∫
* I would like to help scope the computer vision toolkit for DS4S in more detail, including whether it should fit in an existing open source project
* I would like to complete a first draft of the "RAM position paper" ‚ú®
* I would like to start writing a Turing Way chapter (there are several that I want to write: onboarding guide; tool design; maybe something around parental leave and smooth return to work with IGK; also to pitch in to the data visualisation chapter) 
* continue with OLS training
* fix the date for the inaugural lecture of the impact reading group 

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* SH idea: to turn some use-cases for the comp vision toolkit into a Kaggle challenge - thoughts?
* Computer vision toolkit for DS4S - any advice?
* Visualisation toolkit for EnvSensors - any advice?
* Pangeo - any advice?
* Stand-up meetings for ASG postdocs - thoughts? Next training session?
  * KW: SO MANY THOUGHTS! Keep going with the trainings for now and we'll chat more ‚ùáÔ∏è
* How do I encourage postdocs to use the shared github repo? e.g. we could start logging information around which datasets people have gained access to; and where they have been unsuccessful 
  * KW: Demonstrating the behaviour that you want to see is really the best way to go. It's slow.... but the best way to go üåà
* AC suggested that us 3 should meet to discuss the next ASG MGTM board meeting and a possible RAM update presentation
  * KW: Yes - sounds great üíØ 
  * Link to the midterm review and showcase DS4S - will be super fun!

### Date: 7 April 2021

#### Who did you help over the past fortnight?

* HM - on onboarding postdocs
  * KW: YES - a little challenging but really valuable.

#### Who helped you this week?

* IKG (mentoring chat)

#### What did you achieve?

* I feel like I properly onboarded as a RAM within the AI4S Programme:
  * I attended their monthly management meeting - JR with the 4 PIs. 
  * I attended the E&S CTP meeting.
  * I got invited to the weekly project meeting with SH and team.
  * I got added to all of their Slack channels, Github repos, Google-drive folders. 
  * We agreed that in the first instance, my help would probably most useful in refining the scope of their proposed computer vision toolkit.
    There will be a whiteboard scoping session some time in May likely.
    I suggested that we invite some potential 'users' and stakeholders, but before that, we will be doing a little landscape analysis to try and identify a 'niche'. I offered to help here.
  * My plan is to be as involved as possible with AI4S in these early days, since there seems to be lots of goodwill and opportunity for impact. 
    * KW: WOOOOO HOOOO! üéâ üéä üôå
* We more or less finalised our org committee now for the Impact reading group.
  This Friday is the big planning meeting where we want to discuss the texts to start with and other org matters. 
  * Your feedback around posting in the tps channel as we crystalise our questions is taken on board. 
  * I think we will start with Mark Reed's book for the very first session.
    I think there needs to be a nod to REF.
    As well as to The Hidden REF.
    So we frame the discussion within these known and existing parameters. 
    * KW: Excited to hear how this develops.
* I attended CW21 - which was really valuable - I contextualised some of my early thinking about the position paper on RAMs.
  I got pointed to references (Hidden REF, and others too). 
* I spoke with CF (from Partnerships) about how we will work together in covering stakeholders.
* I did some work preparing to onboard ASG postdocs.
  * KW: You did a GREAT job!
    Thank you! üå†

#### What did you struggle with?

* I think I can do better next time we onboard a new batch of postdocs (maybe May or June).
  It felt like I didn't quite grip the situation early enough, I didn't get calendar invites early enough (so what ended up happening is that some programmes booked their folks for the entire Tuesday).
  * KW: I think this is a tough situation - I think there are lessons that we can learn that can go in The Turing Way chapter so that we can be a bit smoother in the future.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Do well on onboarding postdocs - get to know about them and their work. 
* Reach out to AD regarding the RAM workplan for his CTP
* Start delivering on RAM stuff for AI4S - maybe some landscape analysis work, familiarise myself with their repos, etc. 
* Do more OLS training... 
* Engage more deeply with the reproducibility and interoperability resources in The Turing Way 
* Finish any last issues with the RAM JD, and work on the TPS Fellow JD

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Plans for Friday discussion session.
  * Done in the meeting üåü

### Date: 25 March 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* SG, GA (mentoring chats)
  * KW: I'm so glad - thank you!
* Had a chat with EM about her handover
  * KW: So saddddd :sob: but super helpful!  

#### Who helped you this week?

* IKG (mentoring chat)
  * KW: I'm so glad you're learning about the EAG with IKG
* MS (helped me with github, and gave me feedback on OLS tasks) 
  * KW: Great stuff - thank you so much for engaging with all these skills

#### What did you achieve?

* Sent an email to JR regarding first draft of the RAM workplan for E&S theme.
  * KW: Brilliant - feel free to ping SH if JR doesn't loop him in (I think he will though)
* I think I am getting better at Github (I created a RAM repo on The Alan Turing Institute github account and started adding stuff there that I hope will scale to other RAMs and ASG researchers). 
  * KW: LOVE THIS üôå
* I am mirroring the Github repo on Turing Sharepoint for now, but that's for housekeeping for now. It might not continue for everything.
  * KW: Makes sense!
* Had the first meeting with JW to set up our little Impact reading group, and made the first steps in reaching out to people. 
  * KW: We didn't talk about this in the meeting BUT this sounds great although I'm not convinced lots of people will come along... you might have to think carefully about who you _need_ to be there and then invite them. I'd also really encourage you to post questions that come up in the #tps channel on slack - you might get good thoughts from people there if they can't make the session.

#### What did you struggle with?

* I will attend the Shocks and Resilience CTP meeting today, but I am slightly struggling to see if I am adding any value for now. I will be in a listen and wait mode.
  * KW: Thank you for coming. The onboarding work is going to be _super_ valuable. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Make a plan for the Impact reading group 
* Reach out to AD regarding the RAM workplan for his CTP
* Chat with new joiner CF (and NG if need be) to figure out how best to work with Partnerships on ASG
* Attend the management meeting for the E&S CTP and refine the RAM workplan 
* Attend CW21 
* Do more OLS training... 
* Maybe help KW with the Trinity Challenge grant prep, if that's still going ahead 
* I want to engage more deeply with the reproducibility and interoperability resources in The Turing Way- for my education, and to enable my communication with ASG, and to help plan what we need in the future.

KW: LOVE all of these!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Is there anything I could do better/more in connecting with JR and other Theme Leads for now? 
  *  I think the next step would be to start building trust with the PIs.
  *  To prepare training for postdocs. 
    * KW: I think this is a high priority area - thinking of it as a landscape mapping exercise - who are these folks? What have they done? What do they care about? Where are the opportunities?
    * And lets invite them to _The Turing Way_.
  *  To reach out to stakeholders.
* Refining the JDs for TPS Fellows and RAMs 
  * KW: YES - I think I'll make progress on that next week ‚úîÔ∏è

#### Any other topics

There always are other topics and I'm sure they will come up as we chat. üò∏

KW: Thank you for your input on TPS strategy! Excited to work with you üöÄ
