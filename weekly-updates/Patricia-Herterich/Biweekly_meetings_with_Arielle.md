    * will join a follow up meeting to see if [BitList update](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/champion-digital-preservation/bit-list) can learn from Turing Way processes
    * some of this made a really good case for the proposal idea around preserving computational notebooks that's not progressing (lack of time and no deadline)

### Check-in ritual
* Slack back channels for events and other conversations - so my colleagues and friends on there :heart: 

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

* Similar to the Open Research discussion - how do we change the wider system to make this work? 
    * change assessment criteria 
    * how do we prepare people for things that are hard to cover in a traditional training? 

* how not to be cynical about how little has moved so far and how much change is dependent on individuals? 

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

    * preparing some planning to hire a developer - first proper hiring/interviewing process 
    
* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

    * our upgrade highlighted quite a few issues in our deployment process and treatment of GitHub branches - while I like getting those processes aligned, it adds to the current pressure; investigating ways to compensate clients in the meantime

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.

    * ideas where to post the developer job

## After this call
Is there any particular reading/topic/task we want to explore and bring to our next meetings?

### Check-in ritual
* Shout out to LC's friend who has been my saviour in progressing some social events stuff that I was super blocked on :heart: 


## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

* Read lazy consensus - I've done things wrong in the past :grimacing: and left job if that autonomy wasn't there
* Interesting insight into library politics!
* Works well if you have some autonomy/ all the resources to put the proposal into practice
* Needs time to think through proposals - not a good option when you do need to do fire fighting
* Building concensus/connections in a virtual world is really hard - needs to be an extra effort at the moment


## After this call
Is there any particular reading/topic/task we want to explore and bring to our next meetings?
* move next meeting due to Easter?
* Reading: 
    * Preparing for the world after COVID-19: leadership lessons from crises and discontinuous change: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2021/01/26/preparing-for-the-world-after-covid-19-lessons-for-leaders-from-crises-and-discontinuous-change/

* social events were a success and even somehow fun - glad people enjoyed it

### Check-in ritual
*(Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs)*
* My colleague Alex did all the work for the conference and I have no idea how she did it.
    * AMAZING

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

Yes, and I haven't read it yet :(

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

    * reviving my SSI fellowship idea of analysing/exploring the relationship/collaboration between data managers and research software engineers 
        * needs still proper plotting out, but glad there will be time/demand for this 

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

    * No update on the recruitment of our developer job and it gets really frustrating as the workload is too much to handle for the team and there's no real end in sight

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.

    * shout outs to the Hidden REF as we're getting close to submission deadline. Haven't managed to contribute that much in the last few weeks, so need to follow up on that
       * PH will attend TPS coffee on 6 May for some Q & A and promotion   

## Date: 10-05-2021

### Patricia's achievements
* brainstormed and organised a user group for our DMPonline service
* a lot of prep work for a series of workshops the FAIRsFAIR project is delivering over the next few weeks (reviewing certifcation applications for data repositories)
* Talked about HiddenREF at TPS coffee - thank you for the invite
* voted and it felt great :hibiscus: :ballot_box_with_ballot: 
* AB: these are all brilliant! :sparkles: feel you on the ticking stuff off the list :) 

### Check-in ritual
* Shout out to ladies from my team for a rant that was good (not really making any progress, but just the discussion helped)
    * AB: YES to awesome ladies! 

### Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

* it was very business focused - limited application to university situation
* feels like the change worked well if you had/took time to reflect and/or experiment
    * felt like time to do that was the last thing our team had :sob:
* disagree a bit with the "sore loser" aspect - feel like that ignores the potential for activism
* examples were not necessarily COVID-19 related but kind of change that would have happened anyway -> missing out on the unique situation rather than general change 
* overall a bit underwhelming

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.
     * Feels like  a lot of fire-fighting and little active skill building. We do have team away days coming up though I'm unsure what they will focus on (which might be an issue in itself)
     * AB: try speaking to Sarah about the REG away days! (now that you're no longer snowed under with conference work)

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

    * I think I need to prioritize reading ["non-violent communication"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Guides-dp-189200528X/dp/189200528X/ref=dp_ob_image_bk) - seems like a lot of difficult conversations coming up and some more confidence going into them would probably be good

* Anything else:

    * PH is languishing quite badly

## After this call
Is there any particular reading/topic/task we want to explore and bring to our next meetings?
* PH will read nonviolent communication and update in upcoming meetings :heart: :speech_balloon: 

## Date: 01-06-2021

### Patricia's achievements
* managed a check in with my OLS1 mentee, so good to check in after a year :sparkling_heart: 
* managed to send out some nice things to colleagues - had hoped leadership will pick up on hints but ended up doing it myself to show appreciation (learned that from Kirstie and other folks in the lab)
* finally had a chat with someone around the data stewardship and RSE collaboration idea - got validated, still have to make more progress
    * presentation at a FAIRsFAIR Roadshow tomorrow on the bit of work we have done so far
* anonymised some hidden REF submissions for review, award ceremony planning next :fireworks: 
* raised some points at the away day - still many discussions to be picked up
    * raised some of the ideas that I liked from Sarah's notes, they did not make the agenda this time around

   * AB: These are all awesome! & thank you for my flowers as well, they are beautiful :white_flower: 

### Check-in ritual
* Got a wonderful plant from a colleague which is super cute

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

Summary of nonviolent communication (NVC) chapters 1 - 5:
*    Nonviolence = natural state of compassion
*    NVC helps to clearly articulate what you want
*    Four major steps: observe - feel - need - request
*    Avoids judgement, comparisons etc.
*    Focus is on our own feelings and needs and taking responsibility for them
*    What others do is the stimulus of our feelings NOT the cause
*    Direct expression of needs lead to a higher chance of them being met
*    If you don't value your needs, others may not either.

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

    * not sure if it's a skill, but I'm trying to change my style of note taking in meeting - it seems that some points not written done explicitly get forgotten or misinterpreted, so I'm more explicit in my notes now to avoid missunderstandings   

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

    * biggest challenge at the moment seems to be me being frustrated, overwhelmed and tired, so I'm looking really forward to a longer break later in June and some hopefully better weather

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.

## After this call
Is there any particular reading/topic/task we want to explore and bring to our next meetings?
* PH to read more chapters of NVC 

## Date: 14-06-2021

### Patricia's achievements
* co-facilitated a workshop for FAIRsFAIR at OR2021
* ran a user group for our service - first one in a long while, new format, worked pretty much as we had planned 
* presented to the lab about RDA and the plenary we hosted
* presentation in a webinar will be the last one for a bit - I ran out of energy a bit, so this is quite welcome
* attended several meetings around organising the writing of our project deliverables

### Check-in ritual
* Thanks to the NHS for vaccinating me!

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

Finished NVC:
* Requests should be phrased in positive language and be clear and actionable
* Ask for reflection back to ensure the message has been received
* Empathize with reviewer
* Empathy = respectful understanding of what others are experiencing
* Intellectual understanding and diagnosis block empathy
* Listen for other people's observations, feelings, needs and requests; reflect back and ask if you have understood; don't move on to quickly but make sure people had the chance to say everything they wanted
* If you need empathy to give: breathe and give yourself some empathy, scream, take time out
* Connect with yourself for growth, apply this to yourself and don't self-shame, connect with your own needs and motivations 
* be careful if your motivation is money, approval, fear, shame or guilt or sense of duty
* For anger, same steps apply, others are stimulus not cause
* This takes time and practice
* If you use this in conflict resolution and mediation as 3rd party: most important thing is to create a connection between people
* Appreciation in NVC: compliments are positive judgements, express appreciation to celebrate NOT manipulate
* Say thank you by stating: what the person did, what you felt and how the person's action addressed your needs 

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

	* a colleague started reading NVC, will be interesting to see how we both can put it in practice and support each other

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

	* doing NVC in practice in conversation is hard! It's okay in writing, but really hard for me in person (I always struggle with difficult conversations in person)
	* most work things still stuck somewhere - job posts still not out

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.
	* Nothing at the moment, taking a break to gather energy and plan for autumn

## After this call
Is there any particular reading/topic/task we want to explore and bring to our next meetings?

Will discuss reading list properly next time

## Date: 28-06-2021

### Patricia's achievements
Slow period with quite some time off
* progress on project deliverables: one submitted for internal review, one with a deadline this week (I don't have writing sections assigned, just helping with review/editing), my section for the last report is drafted
* delivered [webinar presentation](https://zenodo.org/record/4960239#.YNmH7uhKiUk) - last presentation for a while

### Check-in ritual
* Shout out to our collaborators on various DMPonline projects that are super patient with things moving slow which helps soo much with the work load :pray:

No, we took a reading break

	* We're planning another virtual event and the organisation is as underresourced again. Will require some debriefing and checklists for the next events to ensure this doesn't happen again.

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

	* Annual review is coming up soon - not looking forward to it, I don't think I managed much of what I was supposed to do (and actually forgot what I was supposed to do)
		* PH needs to find a way to track achievements that's not just this document
		* PH to try and 360 degree feedback from team to prep

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.

	* https://www.askamanager.org/2020/01/candidates-keep-cutting-me-off-in-job-interviews.html

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

* Yes, good pointers to help with the interviews 
	* need to spend some time on answers for questions we might get
* Interrupting seems more rude virtually, there are a lot of cues that get lost

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

	* Have more invites for review committees and event committees: I enjoy doing this stuff, but need to properly think about how many of these jobs I can do without it being too much

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

	* Did not have enough time to do thinking and planning	

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?

	* Had a bit of a low while being on holiday seeing that quite a few people make it into (hierarchical, not community based) leadership/management positions and suddenly felt "behind in my career" without fully understanding why

* Finally joined the local department reading group on Toxic Positivity
* Trying to do some planning for the DMPonline service while it's quiet

### Check-in ritual
* The wonderful hidden REF committee and everyone who took part - it was amazing :sparkling_heart: 

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**
* https://www.askamanager.org/2017/12/advice-for-first-time-managers.html
	* Good tips, I might not manage people that "do my previous job" which might make some of them easier. Also think something like introducing a personal user manual could help create clarity with some of the aspects.

* https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/07/16/on-the-myth-of-big-ideas/
	* Interesting - requires time to keep sticking with something, but it felt like the last weeks that were a bit quieter, I was slow with tasks but not as unhappy with the final results as usual
	* Also makes a good point for taking breaks or switching tasks after a certain period of time

* https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/05/06/the-neuroscience-of-busyness/
	* Similar to the above - requires resources to make sure colleagues are not overwhelmed and the to do list can be kept short

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

	* There were some options highlighted to get involved in project proposals etc. but everything is moving slowly

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.
	* Last round of input to the hybrid events guide so it can be published

## Date: 24-09-2021

### Patricia's achievements
* Coding confessions panel done
* Attending OS FAIR: not much new, more of a reminder of all the things I should do and don't get around to
* Trying to finally get the hybrid guide published
* Covering service helpdesk while colleague is away and ran our monthly community call
* Somehow contributed to a project proposal - not entirely sure how that went though, didn't feel too organised and that my input was very intentional
* Booked annual leave to make sure I don't end up with too many untaken leave and also I think I need the break
* Applied for a job just to see what my options are and keep the CV up to date

### Check-in ritual
* Thanks to hidden REF committee colleague Gemma that took a presentation on from me that conflicted with my jury citation

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

Not this time

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

	* not sure I learned anything from being involved in the project proposal which was pretty disappointing

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?
 	* Just seems everyone is overworked, most things are on hold and we're back to fire fighting
 
* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.
	* I'm fully booked but not with anything fun someone could attend :joy_cat: 

## After this call

## Date: 15-11-2021

### Patricia's achievements
* jury duty - insightful
* ran some training with colleagues; first time doing online training after ages
* Shortlisted and interviewed for developer position
* Ran a documentation sprint (co-working type session) with colleagues which was fun
* Ran a "journal club" type session with colleagues which was also fun and useful
* voted for next round of UCU strikes :weary: 

### Check-in ritual
*(Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs)*
* My colleague M who has been pretty good with my rants and encouraging me to take time off when it got too demotivating

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

Yes.  It had interesting parts. The "dress for the job/stand out" part made me cringe wildly.
* There are a few parts I disagree with
* Some good/useful parts (common sense?)
* Very face to face focused, limited applicability in remote/hybrid settings

* Overall it made me think that I'm in the wrong place in my current job.


## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

	* I'm in a quarter-life crisis and need reflection time, but don't even have the energy to do that. I think it will be re-charging over the Germany trip (when they are just going into the fourth wave :sob:) and then using Christmas to think about life and what I want to do 

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?
	* General energy/motivation is the challenge

* Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.
	* Nothing to promote at the moment

## Date: 08-12-2021

### Patricia's achievements
* took time off and went to Germany to see family
* 2 days of strike
* ran some more training (this time with an engaged group which was fun)
* booked some coaching to tackle the planning/reflection for next year (and life in general) with some help

### Check-in ritual
* My colleague M who pushed for some Christmas social and had the energy to organise everything - very good head elf :christmas_tree: 

## Before this call
**Is there any particular reading/task we said we will do before we meet?**

We said we'd look at some exercises from talks I attended, but due lack of prep time, this is my coaching questionnaire prep, highlighting the questions I probably struggle with:

6) What new things did you discover about yourself? *
7) What was the wisest decision you made? *
8) What was the scariest decision you took? *
13) What were your 3 proudest moments over the past 12 months? *

## Agenda and Notes
* Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

	* Making the most out of the coaching is current priority - I have a day of leave next week to write thoughts up properly in preparation
	* I'll present at OLS next week, I think I might even not be super negative about my job and enjoy the prep and the talk

* Since last time, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?
	* still quite a lack of clarity (to me) what my job might might look like, so trying to prepare for more uncertainty
