  * KW: VERY VERY cool - I'm super into this 💯
* Book Dash discussion on advocacy - definitely something to develop for the future!
* Lots of small tasks, each of which keeps things ticking over.
  Trying to keep in mind I don't need to remember every one for them to be an achievement.
  * KW: Yeah - there's two attitudes here - either remember everything and be all "WHAAAAAT that's so much" or say "I do many thing and I am helping other to do their many things" and then rest 💖

#### What bought you joy this week?

  * Meeeee toooooo!
* Walking my Very Long Walk 🚶‍♀️
  * And you raised £2015!!!! WOOOOOOO!!! AMAZING!!!

  * KW: Beautiful 🌞

#### What did you struggle with?

* Several things taking much longer to process, still.
  Not massively clear how we resolve them either (may need guidance from others in the PM team).

* Budget as we discussed 
  * KW: Thank you!
* Also want to think about what documents we would like TPS to have e.g. programme health reports? roadmap? one pager? We don't necessarily need to have them *completed* but I think it would be good for us to discuss what documentation structure we need to have in place to then be populated.
  * KW: Oooooh - this is my jam but also I haven't thought about it 😅

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* What do you need from me ahead of your annual leave?
