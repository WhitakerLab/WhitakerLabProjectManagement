  * KW: WAY TO GOOOOOOOO! 🌄 🌛
* Minor admin things around projects
* Set up 500 words of summer project (hope people find that useful?)
  * KW: VERY COOL!
* Good discussions with PH

#### Who helped you this week?

* MS & HMc as always 😄
* GS has been super with tricky queries
  * KW: Aaaaah - well done! And thank you.
* SR coming to a TPS session and asking excellent questions
  * KW: YAY!
* LC has been showing up consistently for 500 words of summer, much appreciated! 
  * KW: YAY 2!

#### What did you achieve?

* Started chapter on research infrastructure roles, definitely a paper (position paper maybe) on the importance of these roles for research progress and best practice
  * KW: VERY VERY cool - I'm super into this 💯
* Book Dash discussion on advocacy - definitely something to develop for the future!
* Lots of small tasks, each of which keeps things ticking over.
  Trying to keep in mind I don't need to remember every one for them to be an achievement.
  * KW: Yeah - there's two attitudes here - either remember everything and be all "WHAAAAAT that's so much" or say "I do many thing and I am helping other to do their many things" and then rest 💖

#### What bought you joy this week?

* The Book Dash! 
  * Meeeee toooooo!
* Walking my Very Long Walk 🚶‍♀️
  * And you raised £2015!!!! WOOOOOOO!!! AMAZING!!!
* General summery-ness 🌞
* PH bought me flowers! 💐
* 500 Words of Summer has been good - I have been mainly just writing down alllll my thoughts on open source, activism, politics, and policy 😅
  * KW: Beautiful 🌞

#### What did you struggle with?

* Several things taking much longer to process, still.
  Not massively clear how we resolve them either (may need guidance from others in the PM team).
  * KW: So wild.... but if we can help an open source infrastructure team improve their service then maybe we can count this as a LONG WON win?!
* Wasn't on top of my brief in a meeting, need better organisation
  * KW: Hugs - sounds legitimately hard!
* PO system still embedding, throwing up a lot of weird things that need handling 
* Need a clear answer on something which isn't forthcoming and it's causing some things to fall behind
  * KW: SOLIDARITY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* TPS Leadership work, would like to have it sorted to launch soon!
  * KW: Soooooon!
* Budget as we discussed 
  * KW: Thank you!
* Also want to think about what documents we would like TPS to have e.g. programme health reports? roadmap? one pager? We don't necessarily need to have them *completed* but I think it would be good for us to discuss what documentation structure we need to have in place to then be populated.
  * KW: Oooooh - this is my jam but also I haven't thought about it 😅

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* What do you need from me ahead of your annual leave?

  * KW: OH YES - what a frustration. Keep a record on this.... it isn't ok. 
* Sometimes feel like I only have half the conversation for some projects & some are so tangled it feels impossible to untangle them...
