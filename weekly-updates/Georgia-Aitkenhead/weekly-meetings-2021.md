    * We also need to do a bit of work harmonising the code of conduct work from last year with the CoC in the GitHub repository.
      * Technically the behaviours that have been reported are in the current code of conduct but they aren't as clear as they could be, so lets fix that for future community members.
      * We identified a community member to ask to join that work if they are interested / able.
      * We agreed that this work is going to be **written up as an issue** in the GitHub repository and then coordinate with Kirstie to find a time for her to co-work those changes with the community member.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Zoom :( 
  * KW: Can you have a read through of this section - and maybe enhance it for the Turing Way: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/remote-collab/remote-collab-chairs.html?highlight=remote%20working#short-workshops-up-skilling-or-discussion-sessions
    * For example: how do you deal with plans changing? What do you do if zoom doesn't work :sob:? What if the folks you were expecting aren't there? How do you deal with changing agenda items based on who turns up? What if the group is really small? What if the group is really large? How manage very different interests etc? 
    * Remember to join 10 mins early and maybe good to have a back up host / helper just in case there are other problems.
  * We also would ideally have a version of this page for these meetings: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html 
  * A key difference is that we have a broader range of accessibility requirements than a typical Turing Way meeting - BUT OLS has fantastic resources so worth looking to bring those in too.
