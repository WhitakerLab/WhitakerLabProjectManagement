### What do you need help with? or need an opinion on?
* EK - making sense of health data - would be good to talk this through with you.

    * How to comment on someone's PR (e.g. KW mentioned wanting others to review her weekly updates, but I'm not sure how to add comments throughout the document)
    * Unsure what's happening when I 'merge main branch'

* We talked about health data - from EK project compared to ME project, electronic patient records, OMOP and ICD-10 and SNOMED codes. - thanks to ME for her knowledge on this!
* Also discussed ways of working with Github - EK suggested using branches rather than fork. Make a new branch for each weeks meeting, edit file you want to edit, pull request, then add a reviewer (KW) and when reviewed merge it - also delete branch when it askes if you want to!
* Discussed ME paper she is writing - EK suggested doing a research compendium - see link to [Turing Way-Research Compendia](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html) and we talked about using Zenodo and OSF for adding DOI's.
