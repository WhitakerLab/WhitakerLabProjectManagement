#### Any other topics

* KW suggested blog post for Turing website

* Schemas vs ontologies in health care research
    * Schemas refer to how data are organised
        * There are several different types of schemas, including: [OMOP](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki), [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html), [openEHR](https://www.openehr.org), [I2B2](https://www.i2b2.org), and [EAV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC61391/)
    * Ontologies refer to how data are labelled
        * There are several different types of ontologies, e.g. ICD-10 codes, OPCS-4 codes, and SNOMED CT
* How are schemas and ontologies linked?
    * Schemas may specify that you need to a adopt a certain type of ontology
* Not all data falls within an ontology, i.e. within EHRs, there is unstructured data (free text) which each researcher must individually label
    * This means that one may need to have a second database, where data has been personally labelled by the researcher

#### Any other topics

* Standards for reporting medical data
	* KW suggested I look into OHDSI OMOP
* Concept of ‚Äústructured missingness‚Äù
	* KW suggested I be introduced to a group of people at the Turing who are dedicated to the concept of structured missingness. This group is often looking for projects, and my project would lend itself well to them.
	* This group has not yet been established; however, Prof Niels Peek, who will be part of the newly established group, has been involved in [research of similar nature in the past](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/advancing-methodology-predictive-healthcare).
* Earlier work between GOSH and the Turing
	* KW mentioned that GOSH and Turing have [previously collaborated](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-02/the_alan_turing_institute_data_study_group_final_report_-_great_ormond_street_hospital.pdf).
    * This work looked at how vital signs monitoring data can be better used to inform the removal of a breathing tube (i.e. ‚Äòextubation‚Äô) in intensive care units. The work involved the following 3 steps:
        * Identification and anonymisation of ICU admissions
        * Extraction of patient monitor data from the T3 system
        * Identification of extubation times and labelling ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô or ‚Äòfailure‚Äô
    * Representatives from DRIVE were Ben Margetts and John Booth.
    * KW suggested being in touch with Markus L√∂ning and Tony Bagnall at the Turing
