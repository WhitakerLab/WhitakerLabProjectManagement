    - AM: One day I will know something about Terraform üòÇ
    
### What did you achieve?

- Deployed a JupyterHub for a geospatial workshop in Ghana next week! :tada:
   -  AM: Well done!!! üéâ
- Reviewed some submissions for the Hidden REF Practices panel
   - AM: great stuff!   

### What did you struggle with?

- A meeting with a university IT department was full of condescension and disrespect
    - ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And also well done on standing up to that behaviour!   

### What would you like to work on next week?

- Hopefully the Ghana workshop will go well and I won't be needed much there
- I would like to work more on unblocking the cluster deployment for Pangeo (it's not going to be as simple as we first hoped)
- I am presenting Zero to Binder for Digital Humanities with former Turing folk next week
    - ‚ú® all sound fab!!  

## Date: 2021-07-08

### Who did you help this week?

- Someone in 2i2c community who had trouble building a Jupyter Book on GitHub Pages
  - We didn't solve it, but in the process I got them setup on GitHub Actions

### Who helped you this week?

- Min with providing an initial review of my first GitHub Action

### What did you achieve?

- Got a (roughly) working prototype of my first GitHub Action to circumvent the problem of secrets not being available to Pull Requests originating from forks

### What did you struggle with?

- Git authentication within my GitHub Action
- Identity conflict in gcloud when trying to use 2i2c infrastructure to deploy to a Pangeo/Columbia-owned project

### What would you like to work on next week?

- Continue plodding on with the Action and cluster deployment

## Date: 2021-06-24

### Who did you help this week?

- SB fix her git commits to register on GitHub from her preferred account
- CM begin to spin up a small cluster at Turing to add to the mybinder staging federation

### Who helped you this week?

- Yuvi understand more about 2i2c / Pangeo helm charts and the challenges we face working with them
- Min figure out a Kubernetes issue when upgrading Turing's mybinder deployment

### What did you achieve?

- I had a great kick off meeting with Pangeo / 2i2c and opened an issue to track the migration of the first Pangeo hub
- I've made lots of little PRs to various 2i2c repos to suggest docs fixes, and performed code review too
- I moved the Whitaker Lab website onto Netlify

### What did you struggle with?

- Still a bit timid to try out deployments in 2i2c as it's not clear how I can separate myself from the infrastructure in production and, therefore, have a safe space to make mistakes. Raised an issue with the team though, and they agree it's a good idea.
- While there are two people in the team who are in similar time zones to me, they're a bit quieter on Slack. Therefore, most of the action happens in my evening and I can feel a bit at a loose end during the day. I'm sure this will change as the amount of work I have to focus on increases though.

### What would you like to work on next week?

- Waiting for Pangeo to provide access to their current cluster so I can check it out and make a migration plan
- Continue deploying the staging cluster with CM

## Date: 2021-05-14

  - AM: ‚ú®
- IKG with the ethics approval process for the Open Source Service Area user research

### What did you achieve?

- Got panels working in the Jupyter Book and started transferring the Zero-to-Binder tutorial across.
  This means I only have to maintain 1 file with 3 languages, instead of 3 files containing a language each.
  - AM: :tada:
- Caught up with OLS assignments
- Read and made notes on a paper ready to write a peer review report
- Chaired the JupyterHub/Binder team meeting, disseminated the notes and scheduled the next meeting

  - This is AMAZING! Especially since very few folks actually did it.
- Attended a mentorship training session ran by the Turing
- Rounded off the "job ad" for the Turing Beinder Federation Cluster Admin role
  - ‚ú®

### What did you struggle with?

- Not much!
  The productivity management system I'm implementing seems to be really effective at nudging me to realise what I'm supposed to be working on, schedule the time, and plough through it.

## Date: 2021-03-24

### Who did you help this week?

- MS and KW run a Turing Way/Binder workshop for Engage@Turing students
- Other members of my Carpentries instructor training cohort with questions and suggestions

- AN and SC for running such a wonderful training

### What did you achieve?

- Completed the Carpentries Instructor Training course.
  Only the checkout procedure to go!
- Delivered Zero-to-Binder and received a lot of positive feedback

### What did you struggle with?

- I probably overcommitted myself.
  Spent a lot of time in meetings/trainings this week rather than working.
  It'll pay off in the long run, but also probably burned myself out a touch.
- I wish some internal training could be as engaging as the external training I received

### What would you like to work on next week?

- Finishing my slides for my talk at Lund and giving a great talk/tutorial
- Scoping a person to look after the Turing Binder Federation cluster with me

- All good I think!

## Date: 2021-03-10

### Who did you help this week?

- MS think through agenda for HDRUK Binder workshop next week
- CM question on Kubernetes.
  I gave some "this is how I would try and narrow the problem down" advice.
- My OLS-3 mentees.
  I think they will benefit from GA's advice on communicating with dev teams so coordinated a meeting.
- A whole bunch of people (30?) at the SSI Research Software Camp Binder workshop who wanted to know about reproducibility and building binders!

### Who helped you this week?

- KW by being at the other of end of Slack and just knowing how hard it can be
- AM with some fun discussions on what start-ups are like

- Gave a talk on Binder at a Remote ReproHack
- Moved Hub23 onto the same cluster as the Turing Binder Federation deployement, halving financial and maintenance costs
- Explicitly wrote down the minimum tasks I do to support the Turing Binder Federation cluster for transparency and sustainability

### What did you struggle with?

- Deeply embedded institutional biases
- Finding the motivation to work on a task that will likely not be appreciated even though you can see the benefit

### What would you like to work on next week?

- Software Carpentry Instructor training
- Help out with the HDRUK Binder workshop
- Prepare for another Turing Way/Binder demo for Lund University
- Scoping out who could fit the Turing Cluster Admin role if not me

### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

- Continued acknowledgement and recognition that the hard things are hard

### Any other topics

My meeting with Aida today was mostly expectation setting regarding what my role might look like in the future, some therapy around institution culture and contrasting this with start-up culture.
