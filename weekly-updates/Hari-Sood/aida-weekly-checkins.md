* Fitting in role with the rest of the RAMs
    * Seems quite different!

* User interviews
    * Alden has produced an interview ASG rubrik for RAMs for scoping out RAM engagement 
    * Based it on the open canvas methodology, based on lean methodology
    * How can we reuse the template for user testing that I create

* Malvika has a template for documentation
    * Check out cookie cutter documentation templates
    * Big value add if we can standardise all of this in terms of templating documentation

* Interested in pedagogy, Kirstie would love linking in with carpentries
    * Would be cool to do more stuff with them

* If you are a researcher at institute, you should nurture and develop something of your own
    * I should publish a paper eventually, doesn't just have to be coauthoring the DSH paper
    * There are different pathways
        * E.g. conferences, round tables, panels etc
        * Then fostering relationships with e.g. Carpentries - you could then e.g. bring in to different initiatives in Turing

* RAM Website - bunch of YT videos presenting RAM projects - have a look when you have time!
    * Lightning talks are really good
    * July ==> ASG conference
