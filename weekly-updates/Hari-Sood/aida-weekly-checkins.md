* [24/5/22](#date-24-may-2022)
* [30/6/22](#date-30-june-2022

### Date: 30 June 2022

#### Who did you help this week?
* (Need to properly action) but helping Sanger scrutinise DSPT accreditation work
* (Need to properly action) linking up connections from events to Turing work that is happening (e.g. Usencryption)

#### Who helped you this week?
* James R - more and more clarification/guidance on DSH stuff, as well as ways of working
* Arielle - just being Arielle, project management side of things and helping structure/scope project reporting outputs
* Martin/James R - lots of work going into DSPT certification (which I think is drawing bigger issues up about where the project is at). Has been a bigger piece of work than I thought it would be, but the time they have given especially this week has been invaluable

#### What did you achieve?
* DSPT should be nearly done! Or at least clarity on where we're at
* Attending lots of events - unfortunately Birmingham HDRUK event was virtual so less chance to meet people (also didn't make the afternoon), hoping to catch up when I have some time!
* Also spent some time on Monday trying to structure my thoughts/work a bit more... I want to eventually start working in the open on GitHub, this will also help me keep on track of what's going on!

#### What did you struggle with?
* It's been a bit of a slow week getting back into things after being away, especially with jet lag!
* Conversations around DSH that get more technical I struggle with, want to do some upskilling so I can contribute to these convos more effectively
* I think there's definitely a confidence issue with contributing thoughts to discussions, especially from a perceived

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* Start analysing user interviews for IG App reporting
* Flesh out a timeline/strategy for DSH open-sourcing. Soft idea yesterday was to aim for 1st September as the day we go open source. Agree whether this will be the case, and if so, what needs to be done before then
* Follow up/get actions/events/discussions in with contacts made this week
* Spend some more time thinking about the TPS/TTW side of my role

### Date: 24 May 2022

* Fitting in role with the rest of the RAMs
    * Seems quite different!

* User interviews
    * Alden has produced an interview ASG rubrik for RAMs for scoping out RAM engagement 
    * Based it on the open canvas methodology, based on lean methodology
    * How can we reuse the template for user testing that I create

* Malvika has a template for documentation
    * Check out cookie cutter documentation templates
    * Big value add if we can standardise all of this in terms of templating documentation

* Interested in pedagogy, Kirstie would love linking in with carpentries
    * Would be cool to do more stuff with them

* If you are a researcher at institute, you should nurture and develop something of your own
    * I should publish a paper eventually, doesn't just have to be coauthoring the DSH paper
    * There are different pathways
        * E.g. conferences, round tables, panels etc
        * Then fostering relationships with e.g. Carpentries - you could then e.g. bring in to different initiatives in Turing

* RAM Website - bunch of YT videos presenting RAM projects - have a look when you have time!
    * Lightning talks are really good
    * July ==> ASG conference
