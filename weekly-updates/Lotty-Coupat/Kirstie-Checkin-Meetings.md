  - KW: Really great - glad that we're sharing that information a little more!
- Had my DTA! Find out my results on the 16th August, fingers crossed for a pass 🤞
  - KW: FINGERS CROSSED! I'm sure you did great ✨

#### What did you struggle with?

- Struggling to concentrate this week!
  - KW: Be gentle with yourself. Shout to the lab if you need co-working motivation... but also its fine if you're a bit spacy sometimes 🌺

#### What would you like to work on next week?

### Date 27 July 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

- Getting MB and RT the correct access for Github.
  - KW: Great stuff - note to "protect `main` branch" by requiring PR reviews.
- JS and SF update moderation tasks and making them clearer.
  - KW: Really good - that's super helpful 🌠
- SM finding areas for contribution. 
  - KW: So glad! Promotion packs, capturing research / related projects etc.

#### Who helped you this week?

- MS in the last collaboration cafe gave some great ideas on impact pages and culture.
  - KW: ✨✨✨ Really glad that you've been engaging with MS and The Turing Way!

#### What did you achieve?

- Co-working session for moderation clarifying the tasks that need to be done and updating JS on what has been going on.
  - KW: FAB!
- Co-working session for Platform Development with BG - good conversation clarifying how the sign up process works with Open Humans.
  - KW: AH SO GREAT! I'm so glad this was helpful!
- Meet-up last week where we had a great discussion on moderation and platform development.
- Newsletter draft for review and send out by the end of this week!
  - KW: Really great to send to SF and SI for review - fantastic to bring in folks into these tasks!
- Assessment prep...
  - KW: GOOOOOOD LUCK! You'll be great!!

#### What did you struggle with?

- Reading through all the moderation summaries! But they were super interesting and give a really good understanding of the reasons for the project.
  - KW: Delighted that you read these! Helpful in general for you to know all the background, but also really helpful for having additional 👀👀👀
- Few blockers for the moderation tasks due to the need for the Ethics approval. This includes sending out the survey for decisions that need to be made to help inform code of conduct and other documents.
  - KW: Lets do this as a focus group instead as we know we have approval for those.
    - I also think we likely don't really _need_ the survey - I think we've actually got SO MUCH already that getting feedback on completed drafts is more useful than asking for more input at this point.
    - Keep rocking on pulling all the work together and we can present the "first final" proposal to the community as a coherent plan.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Promotion pack for the project
- Impact 1-pager
- Continue mapping out moderation tasks to make what needs to be done clearer
- Twitter thread associated with Newsletter

  - KW: Downstream from the promotion pack? I feel like we need an _ask_ for what they can do for us when we get in touch.
  - If the goal is to connect them better with Autistica then please do that _through_ Bethan at Autistica.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

- AR only has a few weeks left, how do we want to go about thing's once she is gone... We have a chat with GA later on today :smile_cat:
  - KW: 😬😬😬 Looking forward to our chat!

#### Any other topics

- AR is doing great!
  She asked some really good questions in the meeting with Bastian to try and figure out exactly what is needed for the sign-in process and Open Humans integration. 
  - KW: Thank you for feeding back - I'm so glad (we'll miss her!)

### Date: 09 June 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* Reviewed some of GA's PRs for the project
* Running through the user flow with developers so that they understand how a user would navigate through the MVP
* Onboarding two potential contributors to the platform development work
  * KW: How exciting! 👋
* AR and SR mentoring and helping with conversations with BGT

#### Who helped you this week?

* GA and SR have been very helpful in discussing what needs to be done next and helping with idea generation on actions. 
* AR has been great in explaining technical aspects and highlighting areas of work. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Set up a co-working session on platform development
* Introduced two new people to project who are interested in Platform development: MB and IA - I ensured that they knew the stage we were in for the project. 
* Roadmap into MD and google doc
* Shared the user flow and roadmap to attendees of the Platform development co-working
* Lots of re-jigging and updates to the github (quite a few PRs have been merged) 

#### What did you struggle with?

* I've struggled with trying to find a good agenda for the meet-up this week.
  I feel like things are quite platform development and project management focused at the moment so trying to find things that fit around that for people who don't have the technical expertise. 
* Also adding images to github pages?! I've tried to follow instruction I have found online and how GA has done it in other pages but it never renders correctly... 
  * KW: Did it 🙌 - feels good to be able to fix something easily!
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pull/497

* Setting up more co-working sessions
* More Github refresh 
* Planning out community engagement a bit more!! 
* I need to start also my Development Trajectory Assessment work (Fast Stream stuff) 

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Nothing so far...

#### Any other topics

I think AR and SR are much clearer on what needs to be done platform development wise. 
The main concerns at the moment from their side is how Open Humans will fit into the platform from both a sign up/sign in flow but also how it accounts and stories link up in the database. 
We had a catch up with BG where he explained the sign-up flow so once AR and SR start working on it, I think it will get clearer. 

KW: Not many comments in this doc but a really great conversation - thank you!

#### What did you struggle with?

I'm struggling with knowing how to rearrange the github repo to make sure it's intuitive. 
My technologic expertise is impacting how easily this is being down. 
For example, I know what folders I want but unsure which current folders need to be where. 
Trying to work closely with SR on this one - spending a lab co-working session together and working on it.

    I made an issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/448
- Good meet up with Autistica and got some good ideas for the onboarding pack.
  - KW: FAB!

- Created this github file/folder :D 
  - KW: Wooooo! :stars:
- Good intro chat with JK along with SR and IS

#### What did you struggle with?

My concentration last week was all over the place, so I struggled to finish tasks and get ahead.
However, I have entered "time planning mode" where I block out my time and timetable my days which helps me focus on what I need to get done.
I also include some good breaks to get some life admin done and get away from the desk for like 5 mins as well as a lunchtime run for fresh air. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Onboarding Pack
  - Looking into/forming the Mountain of Engagement for AutSPACEs

  - KW: Chat with MS and EK about how they write newsletters too 😸
- Meeting BGT for a brainstorming session on how we can increase the Open Humans communuty engagement
  - KW: Brilliant - delighted for you to lead on this work, please invite SR too if you can.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

- I may need some help on those measures of success for the objectives - I know we put a few of them in the chat but I don't think I can look at the chat after the meeting?
  I dont think would take more than 30 mins of your time maximum.
  - KW: I think the only thing we put in there were the number of subscribers to the newsletter and the number of twitter followers.
    - Newsletter 73 --> 200
    - Twitter 102 --> 300
- Perhaps in our next meeting review of the Mountain of Engagement to ensure it reflects the project
  - KW: Yes - very keen for this - please put a draft into GitHub and ping the link in the Whitaker Lab channel too to get feedback from the team :sparkles:
