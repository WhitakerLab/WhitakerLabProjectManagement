### Date: 28 April 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

- I think SR has been the person who I have helped the most this week!
  - KW: That's great.
    - Weekly meetings set up every Monday
    - Chatting on slack etc

#### Who helped you this week?

- MS showed me the Mountain of Engagement which will really help with the AutSPACEs
- KW with my objectives 
- Lab team - ideas on how to measure success for the community integration objective

#### What did you achieve?

- Wrote my objectives and think it was a positive meeting with Esther.
  - KW: I'm glad it went well.
    - Chatted in the meeting about styles of presenting - bullet points & short sentences up top for the win :wink:
  - KW: Please add your objectives to the GitHub repository.
    I made an issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/448
- Good meet up with Autistica and got some good ideas for the onboarding pack.
  - KW: FAB!
    - Have we archived the summary notes in the GitHub repository?
    - Made an issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/447
- Created this github file/folder :D 
  - KW: Wooooo! :stars:
- Good intro chat with JK along with SR and IS

#### What did you struggle with?

My concentration last week was all over the place, so I struggled to finish tasks and get ahead.
However, I have entered "time planning mode" where I block out my time and timetable my days which helps me focus on what I need to get done.
I also include some good breaks to get some life admin done and get away from the desk for like 5 mins as well as a lunchtime run for fresh air. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Onboarding Pack
  - Looking into/forming the Mountain of Engagement for AutSPACEs
- Planning out the meet-ups to structure the breakout rooms 
  - KW: Worth considering roles and responsibilities on these - what and WHO do we need to run the breakout rooms
- KW: Have a think about the newsletter, probably as part of onboarding & meet-ups!
  - KW: Chat with MS and EK about how they write newsletters too 😸
- Meeting BGT for a brainstorming session on how we can increase the Open Humans communuty engagement
  - KW: Brilliant - delighted for you to lead on this work, please invite SR too if you can.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

- I may need some help on those measures of success for the objectives - I know we put a few of them in the chat but I don't think I can look at the chat after the meeting?
  I dont think would take more than 30 mins of your time maximum.
  - KW: I think the only thing we put in there were the number of subscribers to the newsletter and the number of twitter followers.
    - Newsletter 73 --> 200
    - Twitter 102 --> 300
- Perhaps in our next meeting review of the Mountain of Engagement to ensure it reflects the project
  - KW: Yes - very keen for this - please put a draft into GitHub and ping the link in the Whitaker Lab channel too to get feedback from the team :sparkles:

#### Any other topics

Updates from SR - Weekly Chats:
- She is starting to look into how to use Github to pull out data on Issues being closed and Pull Requests being merged. 
- I have said I will send her a list of requirements of what I envision the Progress Update to look like which will include the above information. 
- We discussed the fact that she successfully downloaded the docker to run the website on Windows, next steps is to look at the issues for areas to work on. 
- She is also looking into how Open Humans and the platform interlink from a data perspective. 

KW: Delighted that you're working so well with SR! 
Let me know if you need help setting up weekly meeting notes like these ones with her, and please remember to use the issues in the two GitHub repositories to track what you're both working on 🌠
