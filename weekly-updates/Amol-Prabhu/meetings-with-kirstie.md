# Amol meetings with Kirstie

*Meetings are scheduled every 2 weeks*

## Date: Tue 16th November

#### Who did you help this week?

* I will be covering for Emma at the DECOVID meeting on Thursday morning by taking minutes. I also kept time at the last AutSPACEs Community Meetup.

#### Who helped you this week?

* Emma helped me by checking in and going through the DECOVID data access legacy document with me. 

#### What did you achieve?

* This week I successfully organised an presentation on the Fast Stream and delivered it to a group of QMUL students. 

#### What did you struggle with?

* I am currently still waiting on a response from a few people regarding introductory talks about data access requirements. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I hope to start work on data access requirements - my starting point will be to obtain some up-to-date feedback on the existing legacy document, and provide an update at the next DECOVID meeting
* I also hope to have specifically determined my contributions to the AutSPACEs project. 

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* If I haven't heard back from the data access key players by the end of the week I would appreciate some support from Kirstie in setting up these meetings! 

#### Any other topics

I still don't have access to the DSH, I have been liaising but am also still waiting on a response here.
