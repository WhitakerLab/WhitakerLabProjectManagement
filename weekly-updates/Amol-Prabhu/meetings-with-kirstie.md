## Date: Wed 26th January 2022

#### Who did you help this week?

* Last week was away in Budapest but have since taken on the responsibilities of facilitating the DECOVID data extract moment and curating and circulating the DECOVID monthly newsletter, helping to free more time up for EK. Also before going away I took notes at the AutSPACEs monthly meetup and shared the comments and suggestions to GitHub
  * KW: Fantastic - thank you for taking these tasks on.

#### Who helped you this week?

* EK provided comments on my section in the DECOVID data paper which allowed me to revise and add parts before the paper was circulated. 
  * KW: Fab üëç

#### What did you achieve?

* Had a more thorough recharge on holiday than over Xmas which has allowed me to come back this week with a focus to finish up writing the AutSPACEs data paper for a first draft review. 
  * KW: Glad you had this recharge üîã

#### What did you struggle with?

* Turning my mind to writing my End Posting Review, need to get thinking about describing and relaying behaviours and actions, turning to my trusty planner and to-do list for this!
  * KW: Due in March.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Get started on the EPR, start collecting, logging and evaluating comments from DECOVID data paper review, finish AutSPACEs paper first draft 
* KW: DECOVID newsletter too - January edition with a celebration of the Exec meeting.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Review of the AutSPACEs data paper.
  * KW: Done in the meeting - pinged a version back to you üòÑ
* Forward planning and review of milestones and deadlines for when I finish
  * KW: Yes - bring these to our meeting when you want to go over them?
  * 1 Feb and 15 Feb - although this one might have to move?
* Start thinking about how to tie up any loose ends
  * KW: üëç
* Potentially start thinking about writing up a handover doc for the next FSer (if there is one)
  * KW: There won't be a fast streamer BUT there will be others joining the AutSPACEs project - so a handover will be very useful... just not to a fast streamer I think!

#### Any other topics

* Slightly less in terms of recent review as I was away over Xmas and last week but approaching the final stretch now (sadly) so looking to make the most of the next two months here! 

## Date: Wed 15th December 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* Reviewed and made some comments on GA's moderation report but will discuss further before approving PR together
  * KW: Great stuff
* Held role of time keeper and note taker at AutSPACEs community meetup
  * KW: Thank you for keeping everyone on track!

#### Who helped you this week?

* KW helped to put me on the right track to continue shaping the AutSPACEs data paper
  * KW: I'm glad this was helpful - easier to get going in the new year I think!

#### What did you achieve?

* Reviewed the PIONEER Data Request form and made notes on what the DECOVID team can help researchers with accessing to contribute to that section of the paper and asked PIONEER for a bit of insight into some of the questions
  * KW: This is helpful - a little blocked but probably enough to add in those links to point to the links on Pioneer.
* Started writing up the AutSPACEs paper and got some more insights from the community meetup where I took notes and kept time
  * KW: Great stuff - really helpful to get started so we can iterate ‚ú®
* Attended a really useful workshop: Conducting high quality conversations and learned a lot about how to navigate challenging conversations. 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Got a response from PIONEER but only to say they will provide answers later this week, once I receive those I will have to review them and see if they are appropriate
  * KW: Yeah - fingers crossed for a reply before Christmas...

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Write up my findings for DECOVID/PIONEER data access questions into the data access section of the paper
  * KW: I think this is good to prioritise before Christmas.
* Have more sections of the AutSPACEs paper written up 
  * KW: Personally I'd focus on DECOVID before this, you have lots of scope to explore in the new year.
* Celebrate Christmas!
  * KW: üéÑ
* KW: Don't forget to deliver to WKW on the comparison of the protocols too. Ideally quite soon after Christmas.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Comments today and this week on the DECOVID Data Access section and suggestions for the next part of the AutSPACEs paper to write before you are away for the holidays! 
  * KW: I don't think you can do the AutSPACEs work before I go away.
  * Useful discussion in the meeting.
