### Introductions
* Emma - I'm a UCl Alumni, not a health data scientist, I was at Institute of Archaeology studying palaeoecology and archaebotany.
* Maria - PhD student a UCL - project on Paediatric epilepsy surgery & NHS data from GOSH. 

### What brought you joy this week?

* EK - LC's talk in last lab meeting. :star:
* ME
  * Spending time with friends in Finland :love_letter: I haven't had an extended bit of time in Finland since... I moved. So it's been really nice having lots of catch-ups, instead of having to squeeze everyone into a single weekend.
  * Lil Louie :dog::heartbeat:
  * Getting into GitHub has been so FUN. Didn't think I'd have as much fun as I'm having :dancer:
  * I looooved LC's talk at lab meeting :raised_hands:

### What did you achieve

* EK 
  * working on presentations for project and Turing Way. 
  * Turing way new chapter - gathering people for case study interviews and rejigging the chapter after meeting with KW. 
  * lots of collaboration work on project and meetings too.
  * Lab shepherding this week.
* ME
  * Set up a GitHub repo for a paper I'd like to publish :tada: How exciting! I've gotten most of my scripts moved over, and am loving the structure and organisation it is bringing to my work habits :surfer:
  * Finished cleaning my seizure/AED outcome data wohooo :muscle:
  * Reached out to HJ (Engage@Turing student) and had a lovely chat :coffee: I pitched having co-working sessions with Engage@Turing students - let's see if the other reps like the idea... 👀
  * Had a great mentoring session with IS - super excited to incorporate her feedback into my script! :pray:
  * Attended a bunch of talks & seminars: HDRUK Turing Health Data Science Seminar, Developmental Neuroscience Seminar, Turing Student Seminar, BRC Symposium, ICH Neurosciences Seminar.
  * Had some lovely co-working sessions with my data buds :sparkling_heart:
  * I was invited to collaborate on a study with a new PhD student/surgeon trainee, and provided feedback on the project proposal.

### What did you struggle with?

* EK - overworking is an issue I struggle with.
* ME
  * Had so MUCH to organise before my flight back to London. And felt quite unwell as a result. Glad that's done. Phew.
  * I'm stuck in my cross-validation script. But I'm thinking I'll come back to it after I wrap things up with the paper/new repo.

### What do you need help with? or need an opinion on?
* EK - making sense of health data - would be good to talk this through with you.
  * Looking forward to chatting about this!
* ME
  * Some basic GitHub things. For example:
    * How to comment on someone's PR (e.g. KW mentioned wanting others to review her weekly updates, but I'm not sure how to add comments throughout the document)
    * Unsure what's happening when I 'merge main branch'
    * How do I add this document to my own forked version of the WhitakerLabProjectManagement

### Any other topics

* We talked about health data - from EK project compared to ME project, electronic patient records, OMOP and ICD-10 and SNOMED codes. - thanks to ME for her knowledge on this!
* Also discussed ways of working with Github - EK suggested using branches rather than fork. Make a new branch for each weeks meeting, edit file you want to edit, pull request, then add a reviewer (KW) and when reviewed merge it - also delete branch when it askes if you want to!
* Discussed ME paper she is writing - EK suggested doing a research compendium - see link to [Turing Way-Research Compendia](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html) and we talked about using Zenodo and OSF for adding DOI's.
