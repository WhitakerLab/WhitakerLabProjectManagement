The crisis of reproducibility in scientific research is well known.
The combination of 'publish or perish' incentives, secrecy around data and the drive for novelty at all costs can result in fragile advances and lots of wasted time and money.
Even in data science, when a paper is published there is generally no way for an outsider to verify its results, because the data from which the findings were derived are not available for scrutiny.
Such science cannot be built upon very easily: siloed science is slow science.

As reproducibility gains traction in the data science and research communities, the need to package code, data and the computational environment is growing.
There are many tools that address different aspects of this type of packaging, such as Jupyter Notebooks for literate programming, Docker for containerising and porting computational environments, and so on.
But they represent barriers to reproducibility as each one requires time and effort to learn.

Scientists work with multiple tools, pipelines and collaborators to produce results.
Project Binder integrates Notebooks and Docker for generating reproducible computational analyses and combines them with a web-based interface and cloud orchestration engines.
This means that analysts do not have to worry about all the moving parts so long as they have followed basic software best practices: their code is version controlled and they've captured the dependencies the analysis needs to run.
Binder then hosts the compute in the cloud and makes it easily shareable by providing a unique URL to the code repository, without imposing additional overheads on the analyst.
Binder, as a platform, provides easy access to the research for stakeholders.

mybinder.org is both a public service and a proof of concept of Project Binder's technologies.
This site serves over 140,000 sessions per week and combines resources from four entities in the US and Europe, including The Alan Turing Institute.
We support a range of programming languages and analysts from a range of research domains, and even facilitate a number of remote workshops and tutorials.
The flexibility of mybinder.org in allowing users to configure their environments provides scope to support a broad range of domains.
See the Natural Language Processing course powered by mybinder.org (https://spacy.io/) and a Machine Learning course for explainable AI (https://github.com/GitiHubi/courseML).

During the Covid-19 pandemic, mybinder.org has seen a significant increase in usage correlating with the beginning of lockdown and many researchers began working and collaborating remotely.
It is quickly becoming the "go to" tool for sharing results and facilitating remote teaching in this new landscape of research culture.

Dr Sarah Gibson is a member of the mybinder.org operating team and is personally responsible for maintaining the Binder infrastructure deployed at the Turing.
During this talk, She will introduce Binder (the service), BinderHub (the technological infrastructure) and mybinder.org (a public instance of a Binder service, free for anyone to use) and demonstrate how it can be utilised to share reproducible computational environments and analyses.

## Relevance

_Please explain the relevance of your talk to the CogX audience, and the global impact of your research._
_500 words max._

In order to "get the next 10 years right", the research community needs to undergo a cultural and practical shift in how we share and communicate scientific progress, towards embracing openness and collaboration more than ever before.
One part of this shift is embedding reproducibility into our scientific workflows.
If code and data are not available for interrogation and results can't be reproduced, it becomes much more difficult to build on top of them and advance the domain.
It is also unethical to do work that is closed and cannot be built upon quickly.

Binder has provided a technological pathway to lowering the barrier to producing and sharing reproducible research, making it accessible to a broad range of analysts on a global scale.
The literate programming style of Jupyter Notebooks combined with the hosted compute so that users don't have to worry about installing and running the code also opens up the results to a wider range of stakeholders who may not be familiar with the computational analytical aspect of research, such as corporate, government and third sector parties.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, mybinder.org has seen a significant increase in usage correlating with the beginning of lockdown and many researchers began working and collaborating remotely.
It is quickly becoming the "go to" tool for sharing results and facilitating remote teaching in this new landscape of research culture.
